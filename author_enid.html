So the Find-Outers decide to try and help the police, by keeping their eyes open for anyone who looks suspicious.

Their form mistress is now Miss Jenks and they no longer have to bear the severeness of the first form mistress, Miss Roberts – who is extremely sarcastic and firm but can be kind when she feels like it, a bit like Mam'zelle, the French teacher that used to teach and is still teaching the girls.—Wikipedia.

The four children are allowed leave of absence from their schools to see them off, though Prince Paul, who since meeting the children has been sent to the same school as Mike and Jack is not allowed to accompany them. It's predicted that The White Swallow (the Arnold's plane) will break new records and there is much press coverage of the flight. Predictably and in an echo of what happened in the story of The Secret Island, on the third day the Arnold's plane disappears. >>> The Arnolds, we learn, do live in London and unusually for Blyton characters, in a flat. Also unusual for Blyton, despite the fame of the Arnolds as pioneering aviators, they do not have the usual retinue of servants. When around six weeks after the Arnolds are lost and the children return home for half-term, Dimmy is there to look after them. [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

Sadly it flies across the field, and over a wall into the grounds of Bartlett Lodge, which is a very big house but is closed up whilst the owners are abroad. So once the gardener is out of sight, Peter and Jack climb into the grounds of the large house and Peter climbs a tree to retrieve the plane which had landed on a high balcony. Just before he climbs down he sees a gas fire on inside one of the rooms, which he knows is strange as the house is empty. Feeling puzzled, Peter calls a meeting and their next mystery is about to begin! [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

Peter inadvertently asks to go to the land of "Goodness-Knows-Where", but in the process of going there the Wishing-Chair is stolen. They eventually get it back and a few days later, the Wishing-Chair only grows three wings. They end up in the Land of Slipperies and when Peter offends one of them, they retaliate by chopping all the chair's wings off, so they get some ointment which grows the wings back. On the next rainy day, they inadvertently grow wings on their toys and the toys end up at Mr Grim's school where mischievous brownies are sent. They befriend a brownie called Winks and successfully get Mr Grim to relinquish the toys. Winks takes up residence in Peter and Mollie's house and they take him on adventures, but on the last day of the holidays, he is sent back to Mr Grim's school for being too naughty.—Wikipedia.
