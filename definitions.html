Following Head's recall to Britain, Lord Durham was sent to investigate the sources of civil strife in the British North American colonies. His famous Report was very critical of Head's tenure. Head wrote his Narrative, with many of his dispatches included, to justify his actions and to argue against Britain's implicit policy of increasing democratic (i.e., republican) governance. This publication is an extended essay, written from a monarchical perspective, that sympathetically summarizes Sir Francis' Narrative while making a caustic attack on the policies and actions of the Colonial Office. Further, it alleges Lord Durham's Report to be either incompetent or pro-republican, or both. [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

It is both a cookbook and guide to home management. It is the first "community" cookbook to be published in Canada and the first cookbook published here as an attempt toward raising funds in support of a charity, in this case for Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. The book was also the first here to introduce the idea of giving the contributor names with recipes. Many cookbooks published after this one copied its style. Due to difficulty with the publisher not being forthcoming with monies raised and controversy over the discovery that some of the material in the book was pirated from a similar book published in Chicago U.S.A., the Hospital parted ways with the publisher and ceased to be associated with the book in 1879. The book went on to be published for 50 years after its original release, by five different publishers, with very few changes to the material it contained.

It describes the journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status. >>> Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space.

There he is the leader of fools and criminals; but Lucifer is very different from that wayward mob. Lucifer’s only crime is that he refuses to bow to any god or spirit. For this crime Lucifer is banished to a desolate rock of a planet. There Lucifer is truly alone; for he has no equal among the fools, common criminals and the wayward. The characters in this play include The Risen Christ, Lucifer, Zeus, Hermes and a dozen others. >>> “Lucifer: A Theological Tragedy,” by George Santayana, ’86, is as remarkable for the high level of its thought and its poetical expression as for the magnitude of its plan. . . .—“The Harvard Graduates’ Magazine,” Volume 8 [1900].

That notable expedition, fruitful in high and useful achievement, for the first time threw light upon the wilderness region that at that early era stretched from the mouth of the Missouri River to where the waters of the Columbia River enter the Pacific Ocean. The vast region now to be opened to civilization, and then known as the Louisiana Territory, came into the possession of the United States, at the farsighted instigation of President Jefferson, by a rare stroke of American diplomacy.” [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own is the first. The book employs a narrative conceit that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled text from the last human species. >>> Stapledon’s conception of history is based on the Hegelian Dialectic, following a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, but it is also one of progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; a consciousness composed of many telepathically linked individuals.—Wikipedia.

Fred Bunce, one of the neighbors, had taken care of a boy named Gus Woonton, who was reportedly mentally and physically challenged. Miss Carter took a liking to the boy while he was with Fred Bunce and his wife, so she paid for him to live at the Riverside Institution, in hopes of Gus receiving proper care for his ailments. Miss Carter receives a telegram that Gus Woonton has died, and Fred Bunce seems quite eager to pay for funeral expenses, which makes Nancy suspicious. [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

Sabina, Emily, Celia, Melinda, Phoebe Lou, Jeanie, and Suzanne are timeless in their appeal—too spirited to be preoccupied with sermons, sickness, and sudden death. However, the feasts, weddings, and holiday celebrations in Song of Years are shadowed by all the rigors and perils of frontier living. Bess Streeter Aldrich's novel, originally published in 1939, captures the period in Iowa of Indian scares and county-seat wars, as well as the political climate preceding the Civil War.

Two such evacuees were Tom and Sheila who were sent from London to live in the quieter surroundings of a village in Scotland. They found remoteness with a capital "R" because they ended up in Kidillin which could bring to mind a cosy little Scottish comunity. There are just three shops in Kidillin but plenty of hills and streams and heather and animals and the sea is only a few miles away where gulls can be seen rising high over the cliffs in the distance.

Blyton paints an idyllic picture of farm life, where the animals are part of the family and, unrealistically, there is never any mention of animals being sent for slaughter!

So says Enid Blyton on the flap and I can only agree with her. I read this book as a youngster and was completely taken into the spirit of the season with the children — Benny, Susan, Ann and Peter. It is an account of one family's Christmas experience right from when the older children arrive home for the school holidays and it is told as a story which ends on the Big Day itself. An associate of Enid Blyton — L. Brimble, helped with information as to origins and meanings of the various Christmas rituals and jolly interesting they are. Did you know — according to the book, Charles II liked loin of beef so much that he knighted it and it is now Sir Loin and if you don't believe me there's a picture of Charlie performing the ritual! >>> In a way, the book deals with a perfect Christmas because everything is there.

The tree is easy to climb and is close by the old empty house. Once high enough, and level with the window of the house, Pip is surprised to see that the room not only has bars at the window, but it is fully furnished. The Find-Outers embark on an exciting mystery as they try to discover who owns the house, and why is the room fully furnished. A mystery that stretches even Fatty's brain, when he finds himself captured in that very room! [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin ("un conte satirique contre Staline"), and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".--Wikipedia.

Enid Blyton seized on this and used it for material in many of her stories and this entire book deals with a family who shared their love with a variety of animals and birds that were fortunate enough to be placed in a home called Green Meadows. The given title doesn't reveal much and one might consider the novel in the same light as perhaps The Happy House Children or others of the Enid Blyton family-life collection but when the fifth or so chapter is reached there's a feeling that there's a retinue of pets in store. Naturally, the thrill of preparing an environment for them can be re-experienced as we remember our own efforts to construct a cage for a budgie, a kennel for a dog or even a vivarium for a newt.
