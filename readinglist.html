The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in London with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. In the Introduction to the Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction, critic Don D'Ammassa argues that it is an adventure novel because the protagonists are in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed.</td></tr>

Enid Blyton seized on this and used it for material in many of her stories and this entire book deals with a family who shared their love with a variety of animals and birds that were fortunate enough to be placed in a home called Green Meadows. The given title doesn't reveal much and one might consider the novel in the same light as perhaps The Happy House Children or others of the Enid Blyton family-life collection but when the fifth or so chapter is reached there's a feeling that there's a retinue of pets in store. Naturally, the thrill of preparing an environment for them can be re-experienced as we remember our own efforts to construct a cage for a budgie, a kennel for a dog or even a vivarium for a newt.

They eventually get it back and a few days later, the Wishing-Chair only grows three wings. They end up in the Land of Slipperies and when Peter offends one of them, they retaliate by chopping all the chair's wings off, so they get some ointment which grows the wings back. On the next rainy day, they inadvertently grow wings on their toys and the toys end up at Mr Grim's school where mischievous brownies are sent. They befriend a brownie called Winks and successfully get Mr Grim to relinquish the toys. Winks takes up residence in Peter and Mollie's house and they take him on adventures, but on the last day of the holidays, he is sent back to Mr Grim's school for being too naughty.—Wikipedia.

The stories are woven together by a framing narrative in which the fictional Dr. Susan Calvin tells each story to a reporter (who serves as the narrator) in the 21st century. Although the stories can be read separately, they share a theme of the interaction of humans, robots, and morality, and when combined they tell a larger story of Asimov's fictional history of robotics. <BR><BR> --Wikipedia</td></tr>
