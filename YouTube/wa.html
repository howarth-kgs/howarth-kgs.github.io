I am sickened.  I’m angry.  I’m distressed.  What has brought me to this point?  There are graphic videos being shared online which purport to show the torture of prisoners of war at the hands of Ukrainian servicemen.<br><br>“The video circulating online shows captured soldiers being shot in the legs without medical assistance,” the Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement on Sunday. The head of the Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, has ordered “investigators to establish all the circumstances of the incident, collect and record evidence and identify all the persons involved in it to subsequently bring them to justice.”<br><br>While it was not immediately clear where or when the disturbing videos were shot, some reports indicate the incident unfolded at a military compound located in the eastern Ukrainian region of Kharkov, which is used by “nationalist” units.<br><br>Read more: Russia investigates alleged footage of Ukrainian troops torturing POWs<br><br>The Exposé is now heavily censored by Google, Facebook, Twitter and PayPal.

And there are additional videos showing Azov’s inhumane treatment of Ukrainian civilians.<br><br>If you have not already seen them, a link to the videos can be found on Juan Sinmiedo’s Telegram channel HERE.  But they come with a warning.  Do not watch them if you have a sensitive nature, they will leave you feeling traumatised.  The description of them is horrendous enough.<br><br>Here is one of those videos.<br><br>WARNING – THE FOLLOWING VIDEO IS BOTH GRAPHIC AND EXTREMELY DISTRESSING<br><br>Yesterday, Patrick Lancaster, an independent journalist reporting from Ukraine, made a video report: Woman Found Tortured in School Basement “Military Base” in Mariupol.  The video is age restricted, in order to view it YouTube “sign in” is required.<br><br>In another video report yesterday, Patrick Lancaster interviewed refugees from Mariupol.  Refugees state that it is Russian forces who are moving people out of Mariupol for their own safety. “The help only came from the Russian side,” one refugee said.<br><br>Another told Lancaster: “We spent a month in a bomb shelter [in Mariupol]. 160 people in a very small room. Without light, without water and without food. We drank snow, rainwater. We found grubby technical water and drank it, and we gave it to our children as well.  All the time we were fired upon by the Azov. They all stood in our yards, shooting from their guns, attracting attention. They knew perfectly well that they covered themselves with our inhabitants, they covered themselves with us.  They knew that Russian troops would not fire on civilians.”<br><br>“In western Ukraine, in Europe and the USA they say that Azov is trying to do something good for people. – They don’t try anything. I don’t know who is trying that, Azov is killing people and destroying the city. That is all.”<br><br><br>Patrick Lancaster: Refugees Expose Mariupol War Crimes of The Russia – Ukraine War, 27 March 2022 (30 mins)<br>In the meantime, the BBC interviewed a Ukrainian soldier sporting an infamous Nazi symbol on his uniform.<br><br>Click on the image below to watch the video on Rumble.<br><br><br>RT: BBC interviews Ukrainian soldier with Nazi symbol on uniform (2 mins)<br>And the BBC now claims that Ukraine’s Azov Battalion is not a Nazi military formation and that anyone claiming otherwise is repeating Russian propaganda. However, the BBC itself for the last 8 years has covered not only Azov’s Nazism, but the wider threat growing Nazism has played both inside Ukraine and beyond.<br><br><br>The New Atlas: Watch the BBC Debunk its own Denial of Nazis in Ukraine, 24 March 2022 (26 mins)<br>If The New Atlas’ video is removed from YouTube, you can watch it on Rumble HERE.<br><br>I want an investigation, now!  I call on the UK government to do the same as the Russian government – investigate.  And I call on every UK citizen to demand of their MPs that an urgent and serious Parliamentary debate takes place immediately.<br><br>This is not about which flag you fly on social media; this is not about which political party you support.  This is about human suffering.  This is about war crimes. Not the type of war crimes as advertised by the BBC against the head of one state, one side of the conflict, to create a perception or narrative, to garner public support.  But war crimes against people regardless of nationality. <br><br>An honest and truthful investigation by the UK government as to who the perpetrators are is urgently needed.  I have long given up on the BBC having any journalistic integrity or stopping their activism journalism, but if the government does not call these crimes out and investigate, then they will fall down the same slippery slope of no return and I have no intention of them dragging me with them.  Their actions are for them, and them alone to answer.<br><br>If the UK government is too entrenched in a particular narrative – disregarding what is true and right – to be capable of conducting a satisfactory investigation then I call for independent investigators to be appointed.  Investigators the British public can trust.<br><br>And I’m not yet finished.<br><br>If a trustworthy investigation proves the UK government and corporate media have knowingly supported the creation of a war in Ukraine and encouraged others to cheer for their chosen side like it’s all some macabre game show, then it is time for them to man-up and right the wrongs they have committed both personally and as institutions.  Either that or stand down and let those that represent the people – who have truth, freedom and liberal democracy as guiding principles – govern.<br><br><br>The Exposé is censored by Google,<br>Facebook, Twitter, & even PayPal.<br>So we need your help to ensure<br>we can continue to bring you the<br>facts the mainstream refuse to…<br><br>Unlike the mainstream media, we<br>are not funded by the Government to<br>publish lies & propaganda on their behalf.<br>Instead we rely solely on your support,<br>so please support us in our efforts to bring<br>you honest, reliable, investigative journalism.<br>It’s secure, quick, and easy…<br><br>Please choose your preferred<br>method to show your support<br><br><br><br><br><br>Send Bitcoin<br><br><br>The Expose Bitcoin Wallet Address –<br>3KpsgfuEX6v7w83aVN4b1dfCZTzas7Kt74<br><br>Send Monero<br><br><br>The Expose Monero Wallet Address –<br>89bg5cqeUpiBq3ci8ZaAco6wh87FP4xJLMXtajv5VkSueijLgmbVxr4fud5qMEih5D2655XGVcHHnVwx5X4idmCS7w3wSxa<br><br>March 28, 2022<br>Official Data in the UK, Canada & NZ, suggests the majority of the Triple Vaccinated are developing a new form of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome<br>According to the latest UK Government figures, most triple vaccinated people in …<br>March 27, 2022<br>Covid Injection Under the Microscope: A New Zealand Microbiologist Presents His Findings<br>There are now four teams in New Zealand performing microscopic examinations in …<br>March 27, 2022<br>Ukrainian Forces Want to Surrender and Azov Forces Started Shooting At Them – They Are At War With Each Other<br>US Navy veteran and independent journalist, Patrick Lancaster, has been making regular …<br>March 29, 2022<br>It’s All Falling Apart for The Biden Family as Hunter Biden Is Linked to Funding of Ukraine Biolabs<br>Emails from the Hunter Biden laptop show that the US president’s son …<br>March 29, 2022<br>Davos 2020: The Categorised List of UK Attendees<br>From Goldman Sachs bankers to United Nations bureaucrats, delegates descended on Davos, …<br>March 29, 2022<br>Confidential Documents suggest Moderna created its Coronavirus Vaccine BEFORE Covid-19 was known to exist;

Any thing is possible. We don’t know who the people in uniforms are or who the victims are. An investigation is urgently needed, To simply brush it off on the suspicion it’s propaganda would be very wrong, akin to gaslighting.<br><br>From my perspective the best indication as to what is going on comes from what civilians on the ground are saying. And I’m not referring to the actors and actresses BBC employs from time to time for their propaganda pieces. I mean genuine people, citizens in Ukraine who are simply trying to survive.<br><br>The problem is the UK government has been lying about Covid, suppressing and censoring the truth and gaslighting the victims of the injections etc for the past two years and so, for me, trust is at an all time low.

Spike proteins are found in lymph nodes of vaccinated people that has died. These spike proteins are causing blood clotting. Because every cell dna is changed by messenger rna vaccine, spike proteins will always be produced in every cell of the body. I don’t want to scare any vaccinated friends here but the blood clotting risk is continuous.

Warren G said of the encounter.<br><br><br>BY PREEZY BROWN<br><br>Plus Icon<br>APRIL 6, 2022 6:52PM<br>Share this article on Facebook<br>Share this article on Twitter<br>Share this article on Reddit<br>Share this article on Pinit<br>+ additional share options added<br>Split Image Of Warren G And<br>Rich Polk/Getty Images for PepsiCo, Jerod Harris/Getty Images<br>As the half-brother of legendary producer Dr. Dre, Warren G had an early view of life at Death Row Records, particularly the structure of the contracts being offered to the artists. In light of the culture at Death Row, Warren G recalls an instance in which he got into a physical altercation with Death Row co-founder Marion “Suge” Knight Jr. after warning his close friend, Snoop Dogg, about signing with Death Row.<br><br>“I’ve never told this story before, I might get in trouble for this,” Warren G said while prefacing his story, which he shared with rapper Talib Kweli during an appearance on Kweli’s Peoples Party podcast. “I told Snoop, ‘No, don’t sign that. You don’t know what you’re signing. You gotta get a lawyer to look at that stuff.’ And I was a young buck saying this!”<br><br>While Warren G doesn’t disclose who the culprit was, he says a “whistleblower” relayed Warren’s advice to Snoop to none other than Suge Knight, who approached Warren G about his comments while at the label’s headquarters at the time.<br><br>“He was like, ‘Aye, blood! Where Warren G at?!’ And I was like, ‘Sh*t, what’s up?’ He said, ‘Aye, blood. You told them not to sign that contract?!’ I took off! But the only way you could get down was the elevator, so I’m at the elevator like [hurriedly pressing the button]. He grabbed me and pushed me up against the wall and was like, ‘You told them not to sign that contract, blood?!’”<br><br>Snoop Dogg Feature Verse<br>RELATED STORY<br>Snoop Dogg Reveals $250,000 Guest Verse Price Tag<br>Warren G then says he was able to convince Knight to let him go, but that the encounter could’ve been deadly had a member in his entourage not carried a firearm at the time. “I said, “Ni**a, if you don’t get your hands off me, ni**a,” the renowned rapper G-Funk producer recalled telling Suge. “I’m calling my brother, ni**a. I’m calling all my homeboys.’ And he let me go. And I had one of my guys with me. Luckily, he didn’t have no gun ’cause he was a gunner. And he was just a short little motherfu**er, so if he’d have had something, he probably would’ve had shot him. And I didn’t want him to do it, but he probably would’ve.”<br><br>While Warren claims to have no ill will towards Suge Knight, he admits that his comments soured his relationship with Knight, resulting in him not being offered a record deal with Death Row. Warren G ultimately signed with Def Jam Records and released his debut album, Regulate… G Funk Era, in 1994, which was certified 3x platinum and spawned the classic single “Regulate” featuring the late Nate Dogg. “Regulate” peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned Warren G a Grammy nomination. It remains his biggest hit to date.<br><br>Watch the clip from Warren G’s People’s Party podcast episode below.<br><br><br>GET WEEKLY RUNDOWNS STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX<br><br>SUBSCRIBE<br>READ MORE ABOUT<br>DEATH ROW<br>SNOOP DOGG<br>SUGE KNIGHT<br>WARREN G<br>THE VIBE NEWSLETTER<br>Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox<br><br>Email Address<br>Email<br>SUBSCRIBE SIGN UP<br>By subscribing, I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.<br>MOST POPULAR<br>Jamie Foxx Blasts Stephen A.

The “mass graves” discovered in “newly liberated” areas of east Ukraine have FIZZLED. <br><br>As with the last go-round near Kiev, the MSM quickly lost interest…..<br><br>…..The U.S. Government never “officially” accused Russia of any particular/specific war crimes….. <br><br>…..And the matter was not pursued actively (or at all) by the International Criminal Court. <br><br>Translation:  It was all just a bunch of crap, like everything else. <br><br>Just a bunch of crap, fed to morons. <br><br>One difference THIS time, is that Amnesty International (after slamming the Ukraine in a report this summer) was not allowed, or was otherwise unable, to access the alleged crime scene(s.) <br><br>As I demonstrated with videos in a recent post, at least some of the mass graves near Izium were of Ukrainian soldiers who were taken (dead) from the battlefields and buried by Russia. <br><br>I showed you videos of Russians picking up many such bodies, bagging them, and burying them in a pit. (A few months later, Zelensky dug up these pits for some headlines, LOL.)<br><br>Well, here’s a video shared today online by Maksim Zhorin, a former officer of the Ukraine Interior Ministry’s Azov brigade (I don’t know who filmed the video.) <br><br>Like many if not most among the Azov, Zhorin has a purely Russian name, but chose to make a career within the most aggressive element of the Ukrainian political tribe. <br><br>Zhorin is one of the “original” Azov members, a longtime Azov talking head, and he remains a grandaddy or godfather of the Azov movement and its local “Kraken” affiliate in Kharkov city. <br><br>(The Kraken are the ones who were filmed shooting Russian POWs in late March or so.)<br><br>His video likely shows suspected Russian collaborators/sympathizers being dumped into a pit in Kharkov region. <br><br>(AFTER the video got around the world, Zhorin added a comment that the footage was taken from some Russian soldier’s phone, LOL. Yeah, didn’t see a need to make that clear when he posted it. I’d like to see that chain of custody. Let’s start with, you know, like, the guy’s name.)<br><br>As I’ve mentioned in the past, they can “get away” with filming and posting anything at all, because the MSM will ignore it, the Ukraine is holy and untouchable.  <br><br>As with the killings of Russian POW’s, these fools put anything online, with no thought at all. <br><br>What are the chances that the MSM picks up, not just mentions (if they do even that) but really runs with this video? <br><br>This is literally the FIRST AND ONLY video I’m aware of, of a civilian (a younger female, no less) being thrown into a pit, hands tied behind the back, bouncing 30 feet down the slope like a rag doll, it’s obviously real. <br><br>I mean, this is a big deal. We have all these accusations, and then BOOM…..<br><br>…..after seven and a half months, FINALLY a video showing a mass grave being “filled” with individually-executed, civilian persons in REAL-TIME. Wow!<br><br>And, oddly enough, it’s posted online not by some “top-level Ukrainian war crimes prosecutor”, but by an Azov-Kraken sketchball! Evidently, it was just getting passed around in his circle… Why not put it on TikTok?<br><br>Will the MSM say this video was made by Russians, or ignore it?  LOL.<br><br>If the MSM has any thought at all that maybe, just maaaaaybe, this is the work of its preferred side… What do YOU think?<br><br>Better to sit on it, no? I mean, it’s only the news business, they don’t need any more big scoops, right?<br><br>Let the human rights groups figure it out! We can wait on this one! LOL.<br><br>My guess, in a few weeks, we might hear a reference to it in the NY Times (likely, Uncle Sam would want to distance himself from this stuff, as he did with the Dugina assassination, using that same newspaper)…..<br><br>…..and, that will be the end of it. <br><br>This is the face of America now.  If you’re American, this is being done in your name.<br><br>It’s another Vietnam or Iraq or Mao’s China or whatever, a reign of terror. <br><br>Literally thousands of “Russian sympathizers” or “collaborators” across the Ukraine have been disappeared.<br><br>Photos and videos of some of these people being beaten, tortured, and/or killed have come out. I’ve shared some of it on this blog, months ago. MSM won’t touch it.<br><br>Probably, most of the “disappeared” are in jail, incommunicado.<br><br>But some, perhaps many, end up like this: <br><br><br>How to know, who’s a collaborator, who’s a sympathizer?  Well, sometimes it’s obvious. <br><br>If you’re a teacher and you didn’t quit when the Russians were pushing their curriculum, you’re a collaborator.<br><br>Other times… Don’t worry, your friends/neighbors will rat you out.<br><br>Are YOU on great terms with your neighbors?  People at work?  Family?  Do they vote the same as you? <br><br>If you’re with a media outlet, and you’re still reading me, and you don’t touch anything like this, and you investigate nothing….. <br><br>…..and all you do is report what your trusty Ukrainian government contacts tell you by phone or email, no doubts, no second opinion…..<br><br>…..just waiting for an easy story from them, just “writing copy”…. <br><br>Then you’re NOT a journalist, you’re a propagandist hack, and (per Dreizin Report tradition) your dogs will eat you.<br><br>(BTW, when I worked at a certain powerful interest group in my younger days, Washington Post reporters would call our media guy and ask, “Do you have a story for me today?” No joke.)<br><br>INCIDENTALLY…..<br><br>…..for those who keep asking me how the war is going….. <br><br>…..the Ukrainian offensives (so far) have been stopped cold, and are (so far) a STRATEGIC FAILURE. <br><br>I’ve covered Russia’s embarrassments, and ridiculed retard alt-flacks (and their retard groupies) who shill for Russia’s Ministry of Defense Spokesman’s Office…..<br><br>…..but the Ukraine didn’t NEED fifty or a thousand square kilometers of outback, or whatever grand achievements the Bezos Post is relating.<br><br>The Ukraine NEEDED to WIN BIG… before winter AND before Russia got to deploying its new/mobilized forces (the sharpest of which are already at or near the front.) They failed. <br><br>They are near the limit of their manpower, while Russia is just getting warmed up.<br><br>They went all-out against the Crimea bridge, and failed. <br><br>The U.S. is running out of munitions to share with them.<br><br>(Yes, Uncle Sam can give them everything he’s got, but in that case, he will have literally zero cannon shells left for his own army and marines, by this time next year, maybe sooner.)<br><br>And, winter is coming. <br><br>Saint Zelensky did not just ask for a “preventive (nuclear) strike” on Russia (I have the video but it’s too much for now) because he has an easy life, LOL.<br><br>He did it because his offensives didn’t work out, and he knows the clock is ticking. Duh!<br><br>I don’t even work for the MSM, yet I’m perfectly capable of stating the obvious… Amazing! How is this possible?<br><br>As a student of Russia, I can tell you that things were looking bad enough for the Ukraine, but the bridge bombing has 100 percent sealed its fate. <br><br>Now, I can rest easy in my prediction (from February/March) that the Ukraine as we know it, will be destroyed. <br><br>Like Michael Corleone, Putin is a very patient guy. <br><br>It is likely that the Ukraine’s nationwide electric generation (best case, nothing else, just that) will be destroyed only sometime after the first frosts….. <br><br>…..when repairing that level of damage (or bringing in and installing new turbines from Europe) will be completely out of the question. <br><br>A big new refugee wave into Europe, dead of winter, while Europe itself is freezing (perhaps also laid low by Variant X), would be a riot. And of course, no modern army can run for long without a civilian infrastructure behind it.<br><br>It didn’t have to be like this, but OK, people at State, DOD, CIA, etc., the thinktanks, politicians’ campaign funds, and the arms industries (which fund those thinktanks and campaign funds) gotta eat, I understand.<br><br>As I wrote even last year (see one of my pieces about the Afghanistan withdrawal, if it’s in the archives)…..<br><br>…..Iraq and Afghanistan are over, Taiwan hasn’t really started yet (they were scared to confront China and Russia simultaneously), and the machine needs a New Project.<br><br>If I recall, I wrote last year, the Ukraine would be this project, and holy moly…..<br><br>LOL. OK, but it’s the kiss of death for that dumb retard “test subject.”<br><br>As usual, when I’m right… I’ll be laughing my ass off.<br><br>I’m a very modest guy, but… who wants to bet against me?<br><br>If you have not done so already, please sign up (below) to my mailing list *****AND***** enter jacob@dreizinreport.com into the trusted contacts list in your email account, so that my messages don’t go to spam or promos.<br><br>Sign up here:<br><br> <br><br>Email*<br> <br><br>Ridiculous Spelling Policy<br><br>As usual, if you wish to comment on anything ko-rona related, please use more-or-less my usual idiotic spellings of key terms (e.g. ko-rona, vy-rus, vary-ants, vakk-seen, vakk-seenz, vakk-syn-ay-tted, vakk-syn-ay-shun, booss-tter shawt, imm-yoo-ni-ttee, pann-de-mmyk, pfye-zzer, moh-derr-na, etc.) or your comment will NOT be approved, as it will be a risk to the existence of this site on its given platform.

A week before the SMO started we were even hanging out at a nightclub having drinks, skip forward to the Feb 24 and my girlfriend receives racist and abusive messages in a group chat from these tiny little softly spoken Ukrainian chicks, who I’ll add come from Russian speaking areas. Now you can talk about workmates all you like but it means nothing, worn out clichés don’t help at all. I am not saying that we should right off Ukrainians or fight racism with more racism but the reality is that there were probably some nice German work colleagues kicking about in the early 1940s that secretly harboured unacceptable views and I am personally not keen to see those views resurface and proliferate, comment such as yours at scale don’t help to prevent this. Now here’s a more thought provoking comment, I haven’t heard any Ukrainian including from within the government call out Naughtyism, despite all the spotlight surrounding this issue pertaining to the SMO, that is a red flag of some deep cultural rot within Ukraines society and should be kind of a bigger deal.

After completion of their contract (same conditions , as regular Russian military man/women) , they are promised to receive a Russian citizenship (if they want it) at somewhat shortened procedure (that still can take up couple of years). At this time , more than a thousand people from my country is getting ready to go and details can be found on VK (Russian equivalent of Facebook) , though , there is a language barrier. Anybody can buy land in Russia – it is not given to anyone. If one wants to make more money (that includes deployment on the front) , it is better to sign up with Chechen military – they are paying a couple of times more than Russians (I’m not familiar with terms of service and afterwards). If you are interested just in citizenship – there are ways to obtain it in a regular way , simply by opening a business in Russia (or getting a job) and applying for permanent residency visa (it takes a couple extensions) and after some years (5-7 , I think) , you will be eligible to apply for citizenship (unless you marry Russian citizen – that can speed up things).<br><br><br>Reply<br><br>dreizinreport<br>October 9, 2022 at 8:01 pm<br>Preparing legislation, LOL.

On the Zhorin topic, did you see the interview Irina Mosychuk (Nightly news host on Kolomoyskii’s 1+1) with some mayor of a frontline village who told her straight up that some guys who were accused of “collaboration” never made their way to jail. I think it was after this interview Zhorin was empowered to write that disgusting post, since everyone in Ukraine pretty much knows that the “pluses” are an official propaganda arm of the Zelenskii machine ever since he won the presidency. Second, Jacob I would like to get your professional opinion on something thats been making rounds on Ukrainian Telegram. When the Soviet Union broke apart and Ukraine became an independent state it acquired a nuclear arsenal, scientists and everything else in between. History tells us that Kravchuk gave up the nukes in exchange for western aid. Recently rumors have been spreading on Ukrainian telegram like wildfire that the “service of bandits of Ukraine” has set up a secret task force of nuclear scientists that are working on creating a dirty bomb, and the reason that the Zelenskii regime has been begging the western world for long range misses is so that they can then send this dirty bomb into either Crimea or mainland Rus. Do you think this plan is actually feasible, considering most of these scientists are older Soviet boomers and probably look at themselves as “patriots of the USSR” not Ukraine. But then again Turchynov and Poroshenko were also “proud members of the Young Communists”, and so was 85% of Western Ukraine before the break up so I guess anything is possible.

It’s Biden and his cast of angry clowns that is looking for a face-saving off-ramp.

This person studied Russian and History. This person claims that Azov regiment isn’t a (neo) nazi organization. According to this person, it is pure Russian propaganda. Most of the sources that I checked on intranet do support the claim that the Azov regime is in essence a (neo)-nazi regiment. What is your take on this as my trusted, and graceful source?<br><br>The relevance for me is this, I shudder from the idea that soon we have a new, young diplomat that is completely anti russian. Whatever one thinks of their international politics, if we want to have any chance of a rather peaceful coexistance, we can’t use extremists (like that soon to-be diplomat).

Clark<br>October 10, 2022 at 11:05 pm<br>My first time on this. I enjoy your comments, and also liked you on Kunstler. I’ve know Jim many years. The piece you had with Kingston radio also very good. I listen to a host of Internet people (The Duran, Larry Johnson, etc.) Many have their differences, but it’s important we have the ability to sift through them and get to a coherent narrative. When I was in college, the most important thing I learned from a poli-sci professor was “ALWAYS question your sources.”<br>Having been in the army (artillery.admin), I appreciate your and Scott Ritter’s analysis.<br><br>Also, I enjoyed your discussion of Alexander Nevsky, and film music. It’s very irritating to hear my classical music station praise John Williams and Star Wars over and over as if he was Wagner. American culture has gotten so low. Did you ever see the Russian movie of War and peace made in the 1960’s? I liked the film score. True, it’s not Prokofiev, but it was very functional.<br>As for this recent thread: yes, the “atrocities” are pretty phony, like ketchup used as blood. Sad how all of it is so easily taken by the MSM, but it shows how our system is so close to a kind of re-adjustment. Everything feels so fossilized in the west.<br>I remember George Orwell recalling when, in WWI, he read of newspaper reports of British troops finding dead Germans chained to their machine guns, the implication that they were slaves and lackeys forced into killing by the evil Prussians. Unlike FREE British troops. He remembered that when, in 1941, he read British troops found…yes, Germans chained to their machine guns, and laughed off the obvious stale propaganda.<br>What’s funny is that I remember following the war in Vietnam, and read of one battle where Marines re-took a village, and among the dead V.C., they found…yes, they were chained to their machine guns. Funny how propaganda gets re-circulated, isn’t it?<br>I get a bellyful of the MSM, people like Bill O’Reilly bellowing “Putin’s deranged…he’s on his way out…our special ops can take him out ANY time we want!” And pimping his latest book, showing<br>“Abu Ghirab worked! Torture saved American lives! Torture works!”<br>Or some local guy on an American “Patriot radio” saying “At least Zelensky went out and gave guns to the people so they could go out and kill Russians…it’s like George Washington. Giving patriots guns to fight for freedom! The Ukraine has the second amendment.” Of course, on the Duran, Alexander remarked how most of those guns went to criminal gangs who started robbing people, and what use is it giving automatic weapons to untrained civilians?<br><br>Loading...<br>Reply<br><br>TomA<br>October 11, 2022 at 2:39 pm<br>Thank you for exposing this genuine evil that is running rampant in Ukraine. No one else is doing this and, as the old saying goes, evil will persist as along a good men stay on the sidelines and do nothing. Russia will hunt these scum and justice will be done. But tears and outrage are not enough on this side of the Atlantic. It is our duty to spread the truth and eventually step up to right the wrongs that have spawned this genocide. Those origins are here in the US, so it is our problem to solve, not Russia’s. The time will soon be upon us for hard men to do hard things. Evil will not go quietly into the dustbin of history. This is the essential reality that must be faced, sooner rather than later.<br><br>Loading...<br>Reply<br>Leave a Reply<br><br>Search Text<br><br>Archives<br>October 2022<br>September 2022<br>August 2022<br>July 2022<br>June 2022<br>May 2022<br>April 2022<br>March 2022<br>February 2022<br>January 2022<br>December 2021<br>November 2021<br>July 2021<br>June 2021<br>May 2021<br>April 2021<br>February 2021<br>Meta<br>Log in<br>Please click ** here ** to be added to my mailing list and receive alerts on any new article. <br>Your "Great Reset" HQ | 2022 | Built with Grigora</td></tr>

Reuters<br><br><br>MK Bhadrakumar<br>Former Ambassador<br><br>writer-info<br>Two massive terrorist strikes misfired spectacularly and a terrible beauty is born in the Ukraine war. These two carefully planned attacks in quick succession — on Nord Stream gas pipelines and Crimean Bridge — were intended as a knockout blow to Russia. According to President Vladimir Putin, people ‘who want to finally sever ties between Russia and the EU, weaken Europe’ are behind the Nord Stream blasts. He named the US, Ukraine and Poland as ‘beneficiaries’.<br><br>India should expect the defeat of the US and NATO, which completes the transition to a multipolar world order.<br><br>Last Wednesday, Russia’s domestic intelligence service FSB identified Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, as the mastermind behind the Crimean attack. The New York Times and Washington Post also pointed fingers at Kiev, quoting ‘sources’. While Nord Stream-1 has been crippled, one of the strings of Nord Stream-2 remains intact. Putin said last week that the pipeline could be restored and Russia could deliver about 27 billion cubic metres of gas. ‘The ball is on the side of the European Union, if they want — let’s turn on the tap,’ he said.<br><br><br>But mum’s the word from Brussels. It is a profoundly embarrassing moment for the EU. The triumphalism has vanished as Europe is threatened by years of recession caused by the blowback from sanctions against Russia, where the US insisted on the cut off of energy ties with Moscow. The EU has now become a captive market for Big Oil and is left to buy LNG from the US at the asking price, which is six to seven times higher than the domestic price in the US. (Contracted price for long-term Russian supply for Germany used to be about $280 per 1,000 cubic metres as against the current market price hovering around $2,000.)<br><br>Plainly put, the Europeans have been nicely played by the Americans. India should take note of the US’ sense of entitlement. Basically, the Biden administration created a contrived energy crisis whose real aim is war profiteering.<br><br><br>The Crimean Bridge attack of October 8 is much more serious. Zelenskyy has crossed a red line that Moscow had repeatedly warned him against. Putin has disclosed that there have also been three terrorist attacks against the Kursk NPP. Russians will settle for nothing less than the ouster of the Zelenskyy regime.<br><br>Russia’s retaliation against Ukraine’s ‘critical infrastructure’, something Moscow refrained from so far, has serious implications. Since October 9, Russia has begun systematically targeting Ukraine’s power system and railways. Noted Russian military expert Vladislav Shurygin told Izvestia that if this tempo was kept up for a week or so, it ‘will disrupt the entire logistics of the Ukrainian military — system for transporting personnel, military equipment, ammunition, related cargo, as well as the functioning of military and repair plants.’<br><br>The Americans are cocooned in a surreal world of their self-serving narrative that Russia ‘lost’ the war. In the real world, though, Ivan Tertel, KGB chief in Belarus, who has an insider view of Moscow, said last Tuesday that with Russia boosting its troop strength in the war zone — 3 lakh troops who have been mobilised plus 70,000 volunteers — and the deployment of advanced weaponry, ‘the military operation will enter a key phase. According to our estimates, a turning point will come in the period from November of this year to February of next year.’<br><br>Policy-makers and strategists in Delhi should make a careful note of the timeline. The bottom line is, Russia is looking for an all-out victory and will not settle for anything less than a friendly government in Kiev. Western politicians, including Biden, understand that there is nothing stopping the Russians now. The US’ weapon kitty is running dry as Kiev keeps asking for more.<br><br>When asked whether he’d meet Biden at the G20 in Bali, Putin derisively remarked on Friday, ‘He (Biden) should be asked whether he is ready to hold such negotiations with me or not. To be honest, I don’t see any need, by and large. There is no platform for any negotiations for the time being.’<br><br>However, Washington has not yet thrown in the towel and the Biden administration remains obsessed with exhausting the Russian military — even at the cost of Ukraine’s destruction. And, for the Russians too, there is still much to be worked out on the battlefield: the oppressed Russian populations in Odessa (which suffered unspeakable atrocities from the neo-Nazis), Mykolaiv, Zaporizhya, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkov are expecting ‘liberation’. It’s a highly emotive issue for Russia. Again, the overarching agenda of ‘demilitarisation’ and ‘denazification’ of Ukraine must be taken to its logical conclusion.<br><br>When all that is over, Putin knows Biden will not even want to meet him. Hungarian PM Viktor Orban said last week, ‘Anyone who seriously believes that the war can be ended through Russian-Ukrainian negotiations lives in another world. Reality looks different. In reality, such issues can only be discussed between Washington and Moscow. Today, Ukraine is able to fight only because it receives military assistance from the United States…<br><br>‘At the same time, I do not see President Biden as the person who would really be suitable for such serious negotiations. President Biden has gone too far. Suffice it to recall his statements to Russian President Putin.’<br><br>India should expect the defeat of the US and NATO, which completes the transition to a multipolar world order. Sadly, Indian elites are yet to purge their ‘unipolar predicament’. Europe, including Britain, is devastated and there is palpable discontent over the US’s ‘transatlantic leadership’. Indo-Pacific strategy is hopelessly adrift. New power centres are emerging in India’s extended neighbourhood, as the OPEC’s rebuff to Washington shows. A profound adjustment is needed in the Indian strategic calculus.<br><br> <br><br>Trending News  <br><br>Also In This Section<br>Which way China will go<br>Time the electoral system is reviewed<br>Addressing the deeply emotive language issue<br><br><br><br>Top News<br>Interpol meet: PM Modi calls international community to ‘eliminate safe havens’ for terrorists, criminals and the corrupt<br> 6 hours ago<br>Interpol meet: Pakistan’s FIA chief stays mum on whereabouts of fugitive terrorists Dawood Ibrahim, Masood Azhar<br> 5 hours ago<br>Himachal Assembly polls: Congress announces names of 46 candidates; see full list<br> 3 hours ago<br>7 dead as helicopter ferrying Kedarnath pilgrims crashes; President Murmu, PM Modi condole loss of lives<br> 10 hours ago<br>Indus Waters Treaty: World Bank appoints neutral expert, chairman of Court of Arbitration<br> 5 hours ago<br><br>Don’t Miss<br>View All<br>Soan Papdi: Love it, hate it, but you can't ignore this Diwali sweet<br> 10 hours ago<br>View all stories in this section<br><br>Most Read<br>1<br><br>LUDHIANA<br>PAU V-C not appointed as per UGC norms, remove him, Punjab Governor tells CM Bhagwant Mann<br> 10 hours ago<br>2<br><br>PUNJAB<br>Christians demand arrest of Sikh activist Amritpal Singh, lodge protest at Jalandhar's PAP Chowk<br> 17 hours ago<br>3<br><br>PUNJAB<br>Drug addict kills wife, 2 kids, parents-in-law by setting them afire at Jalandhar farm<br> 10 hours ago<br>4<br><br>NATION<br>7 dead as helicopter ferrying Kedarnath pilgrims crashes; President Murmu, PM Modi condole loss of lives<br> 10 hours ago<br>5<br><br>PUNJAB<br>PRTC seeks permission to pick up passengers from IGI's T3<br> 17 hours ago<br>6<br><br>JALANDHAR<br>Sunder Sham Arora — from stall owner to big-time realtor<br> 16 hours ago<br>7<br><br>PUNJAB<br>Will modify ration-on-doorstep scheme, Punjab govt tells High Court<br> 18 hours ago<br>8<br><br>CHANDIGARH<br>ED attaches Rs 185 crore worth of assets of Chandigarh pharma company for bank fraud<br> 8 hours ago<br>9<br><br>NATION<br>Panel holds Sasikala 'guilty' of Jayalalithaa's death<br> 11 hours ago<br>10<br><br>CHANDIGARH<br>Punjab, Haryana Bar Council condemns NIA ‘raid’ at Chandigarh advocate’s residence<br> 7 hours ago<br><br>Copyright © The Tribune Trust, 2022<br><br>Designed and Developed by: Grazitti Interactive</td></tr>
