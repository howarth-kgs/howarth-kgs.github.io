He went inside, and the engineer closed the door and a few minutes later, Cage emerged and said, "It wasn"t totally silent in there. I heard some sound." "Was it a deep, thobbing sound and a high, white noise-like sound?" "Why yes!" Cage replied with a slight grin. "The deep sound was the sound of your heart and circulatory system, and the high sound was your nervous system"s background noise." the engineer said.<br>MagicMike [7k]~hey roomies<br>PepperX [8k]Shhhhh!

I never took drugs in my life beside tenin and caffein :-)<br>Khaleesi [-]good advice eps<br>okiol [1k]if it is genghis and genghis is a real person roughly as he has portrayed himself, then he does have high education... not that that would be relevant, but anyway<br>Epsilion [3k?]and read Kageyama<br>Bayesian [1k]Here is a short book on it, https://files.catbox.moe/u3xhd1.pdf<br>LinuxGooo [7k]tks ...

My problem is the "emotional state". Herewith I misjudge situations, do wrong assumptions and then miss the right/good moves. So its more a psychological thingy why I stuck.<br>Epsilion [3k?]he says in that book there is often a barrier at 7k, i had it too<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Fear, worries, anxiety .... lack of self confidence, underestimating own strength, overestimating opponent"s strength ...

Strengthen the fundaments, to get own emotoins under control, hm.<br>okiol [1k]there are a few things i"d tell a 7k as general rules, but perhaps the most useful, that is easiest to study on one"s own, and which requires comparatively little work but which contributes greatly to the ability to judge a situation and also to kill and live, and that is learning the L shape in the corner, and the principle of 6 is dead, 7 is undecided, 8 is alive<br>LinuxGooo [7k]sure, reading skills have a big impact to avoid bigger losses.<br>okiol [1k]i frequently kill people around 1k-1d who don"t understand this properly, because i can see far ahead whether a group is going to die or not<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Rarely I lose my groups, doesnt happen very often in my games.<br>okiol [1k]it"s not about just reading as such, it"s a very specific set of let"s call them "shapes" that have to do with life and death that recurr frequently in games<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But more, because I "lack of aggressivity", I let live my opponent ... I am a very peaceful, gentle player. :-)<br>okiol [1k]and if you just know to look for them, they"re very common, even in games they never happen, they can be used for reading<br>alfalfa [4k]i was afk, but it does my heart good to see people talking about... go... in here<br>Epsilion [3k?]yeah that"s rare eh<br>LinuxGooo [7k]My fears, worries, anxiety gets less over the years. Sometimes I even try "crazy stuff", just to move into a tough fighting to train my skills. In the beginning on KGS (in 01/2014) I had huge fears, I had to stand up and go away from the board when I have seen that I come into trouble. Felt like my pulse was on 180 ... similar to a live threatening situation. This stress is gone meanwhile. :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So it works for me out positively, that I use GO as a kind of anti-anxiety self therapy.

I like that.<br>Animation [3k]i see language as computation<br>okiol [1k]i just think it"s funny that chess is considered the "ultimate game for genuises" or whatever in much of the west, while there are so much more complex and beautiful old strategy board games...<br>Animation [3k]go is a type of computation also<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have my doubts, that Chess would be so popular without IBM nowadays.<br>Animation [3k]but i don"t like adversarial communications like Go, i prefer constructive communication<br>okiol [1k]i think IBM is a contingency.

So a compass needs to be gimbaled against all 3 axes, its not related to the latitude. What you might mean is the so called "magnetic compensatoin", which has two factors: ship magnetism, and earth magnetism (related to longitude and latitude = position of the ship).<br>Bayesian [1k]right, and otherwise the compass is automatically balanced when manufactured<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the course of the ship finally defines the concrete value of "magnetic compensatoin", a correcting parameter we calculate to define the ship course (magnetic course) from the chart / map course.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The mounting on the ship itself depends a lot on the ship magnetism. Not every mounting system is adequate. A compass is always adapted individually to each ship. Its veryx expensive to install a compass, as it needs specialists who are allowed to do it. And give the compass on the ship a certificate.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Couple of years ago I worked on a 2 masted steel ship, its compass was total worthless. Because of a strike in a thunderstorm, the hull + superstructure (both made of steel) became so extreme magnetized, that no compass could be used. We only navigated with GPS.

So no idea how that is going<br>Alex1888 [3k]through the pc<br>Alex1888 [3k]by usb cable<br>PepperX [7k]Apple and Google update your phone when and as they like.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Ist just clicking the "update" button of the installed software I suppose<br>PepperX [7k]And the flash ROM image that is used to update the drone"s firmware, the image file on your PC, where does that come from?<br>Alex1888 [3k]from the manufacturer<br>PepperX [7k]Yes,<br>LinuxGooo [7k]you get the app on Google play, check "dJI Go app". after installation, you just select, what kind of drone you have, and then click the firmware update button. thats it<br>PepperX [7k]OK. Sounds totally safe.<br>Alex1888 [3k]there are special programs to load the firmware<br>LinuxGooo [7k]For computer its the "DJI Assistant 2", you get it on dji.com as download<br>PepperX [7k]There are also special programs to decompile/disassemble the firmware, but that is not for kyu level droners.......not even for lower dan level droners.<br>Alex1888 [3k]haha<br>Alex1888 [3k]yes, but its not that difficult, after all<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Today I wanted make a photo of our summer place, I had to enter the private ground of a steel company. So I asked the staff if I can go to the pier to make a photo. They said "no". So what I will do now I organize a Drone, and voila I will get my pics by a fly over on a weekend on this ground. :-)<br>Meepy [-]bad idea, asking for permission<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I had to .... the staff has seen me ... imagine, you come along with your bike, hiking through the different factory halls. So I had to ask.

I tenuki"d.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yeah, a very bad idea to send now the Flak tank Gepard.<br>SamSpade [3d]why?<br>SamSpade [3d]gotta support Ukraine somehow<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an ex General of German army was interviewed today and he said: He does not get this idea, because the Gepard is the most complicated tank with lots of electronics .... it takes months to train the crew to manage this system safely.<br>PepperX [7k]Seems better than helmets, and what was initially sent? Beds? Beds and 5000 helmets?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Gepard is too complicated by its electronics, so the General.<br>okiol [1k]basic stuff shouldn"t be undersestimated either<br>akinn [3k]~it is not designed for assymetric<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So Germany has some more "simple" tanks, the crews can be trained more easily and more quickly, either the Marder or the Leopard 1. So why sending now a highly compexe system ? Does not go together all this.<br>okiol [1k]maybe ukraine has told them that they have people capable of manning them, and that they"d be useful to counter whatever russia has?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have no good feeling about all the development of this war .... it feels it already escalated (from side of NATO/EU and USA).<br>okiol [1k]if i have understood things correctly it seems ukraine tell other countries what it needs and hope to receive it, other countries don"t just give random stuff<br>PepperX [7k]Well, compare the beginnings of WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Putin deserver most of the blame, right?<br>akinn [3k]~when or as this stared ukraine asked for nukes<br>PepperX [7k]He seems to be the initiator.<br>SamSpade [3d]indeed<br>okiol [1k]is there a good comparison to be made between this and ww2? i don"t think so<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the big meeting of 40 countries on US airbase Rammstein in Germany to plan what kind of weapon systems shall be delivered, that overstepped a line (from Russia perspective). I think we are now close to the beginning of WW3, sadly.<br>okiol [1k]i mean compare to like 20 other events that has taken place since ww2<br>akinn [3k]~sudeten chechya , deutschlnd croatia and ukraine also needed arms, there are certainly paralels<br>PepperX [7k]There are some interesting speeches that Putin gave, in the past, about restoring past glory.<br>akinn [3k]~finalnd..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an expert about Russia said today in an interview: For Putin, its not about the war against Ukraine or against EU/NATO. Finally its to fight USA. Russia doesnot take NATO/EU serious, seeing it as a marionet/puppet of US inerests.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]interests*<br>PepperX [7k]One parallel is that in WWII, countries that were not directly affected just stood by, did little.<br>akinn [3k]~i am glad he finally cuts some gas deliveries, and i wonder why he anounced early he would after spring<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yeah, gas delivery to Poland will be cut now<br>akinn [3k]~after winter<br>akinn [3k]~ rather<br>SamSpade [3d]it"s a war between only two countries, so far<br>SamSpade [3d]not much world war over it<br>okiol [1k]why are you glad for that, akinn?<br>PepperX [7k]US keeps sending weapons.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Russia cuts the gas and oilpipeline to Germany, then Germany"s economy will break down.<br>okiol [1k]usa and russia has supported opposing sides many times since ww2 with weapons and such<br>PepperX [7k]It is a proxy war.<br>akinn [3k]~less chance ppl will freeze next winter because everything is putins fault<br>PepperX [7k]France has, what? 75% nuclear?<br>okiol [1k]so you mean that you"re glad that he cut it late?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Not for Putin, SamSpade. Also Ukraine is only a puppet of USA, And as we see it now, indeed, its true. USA has already pumped nearby 4 billion US dollars of weapons into Ukraine in last 2 months. From Putin"s perspective, all what happened last 60 days, confirms him that he was right: East expansion of NATO will threaten Russia.<br>akinn [3k]~both tht he cut it late and that he cut some in time they cant shun the responmsability until epople freeze<br>okiol [1k]i give putin more credit than that, linuxgoo<br>SamSpade [3d]I am more worried about Russsia threatening east europe right now<br>PepperX [7k]That is the parallel with WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia was never at risk of being invaded<br>okiol [1k]even though russia is obviously just doing it to raise tensions, it"s just a generally bad thing that they use their nukes to poster so much<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think we have to expect a so called "strategical nuclear strike" by Russia, similar we have seen it with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if Putin should see, that he lost ground in Ukraine by enforcing Ukraine military by US/NATO weapons.<br>SamSpade [3d]when that happens, people will no doubt blame everyone but Russia<br>okiol [1k]i don"t think putin will deploy any nukes in a strategical manner<br>PepperX [7k]Putin does tactical nukes on Ukraine. Then what?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]blowing off the landscape one of Europe"s big cities, Amsterdam, Madrid, Berlin, Rome, London .... thats the final optoin for Putin to get what he wants.<br>okiol [1k]if this turns nuclear, it will be because of tensions rising and someone making a mistake<br>akinn [3k]~ofc he will<br>akinn [3k]~they anounced it beforehand<br>okiol [1k]tactical nuke is a bit different<br>akinn [3k]~the russian army cant win , they loose too much manpower as well<br>akinn [3k]~nato only thinks of arming up making the war worse<br>okiol [1k]they"re currently winning in the east<br>akinn [3k]~and saying putin causes the escalation<br>LinuxGooo [7k]tactical nukes have "only" a local effect. So it wont destroy whole Europe. But it would be enough to see people dying by radiation contaimnation that the world leaders say: Stop, we cant go on with that, same as Japan declared its capitulation.<br>akinn [3k]~sos there will be no meaningful negotiations before the tactical need is absolute<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia has offered again negotiations yesterday or today, I think.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But didnt get any answer yet, as so often in last 19 years<br>SamSpade [3d]I don"t think Russia wants peace<br>okiol [1k]anyone arguing that putin isn"t the one raising the tensions is probably trying on purpose to be wrong<br>akinn [3k]~that is an underrepresentation of the russian willing ness to negotiate<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I fear now, that USA misuses Europe, to get dominance over Russia, mainly to control the oil market. So it feels for me.<br>okiol [1k]i"m sorry what you"re saying makes no sense, linux<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Europe already started to make deals with USA to import energy from USA, to replace the Russian deliveries.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So Europe will become more dependent from USA in the future<br>akinn [3k]~i also think it is only about money and pressurising russians and has been that for 8 yrs<br>okiol [1k]europe isn"t some puppet of usa first of all, the euro-zone is considerably wealthier than usa. Second, russia doesn"t really have that much oil<br>SamSpade [3d]europe going electric<br>okiol [1k]they have some oil, but it"s not like russia is the key to dominating world oil...<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Okiol, related to military power EU/Nato is a puppet of USA<br>LinuxGooo [7k]that is what counts for Putin<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the threat is not the economical power of Europe or Germany ... contrary, the German-Russian busines srelationships did go very well<br>LinuxGooo [7k]its all about the military dominance, and here exist only 3 super powers in the world: Russia, USA and China.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin hates it, that USA and its military power has such a big influence in the world.<br>PepperX [7k]There is an interesting 11 part BBC podcast on Putin: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0015nfd/episodes/guide Yes, I know, it"s the BBC, but they have some interesting interviews with people that know and worked with him.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]USA had kept silent now for very long during last 2 months, Biden was very covered not to support Ukraine, but with the meeting yesterday (Tuesday) on Rammstein US Airbase in Germany it clearly shows, that US military now starts to overtake a leading role. I dont think, thats what Putin likes to see.<br>PepperX [7k]And Putin probably doesn"t like to listen to Rammstein, but maybe........<br>SamSpade [3d]more of a kraftwerk fan, maybe?<br>PepperX [7k]Some of those Rammstein songs, sound like a military march, you know?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Foreign minister Sergey lavrov spoke yesterday first time for a serious situatoin, that we are close to WW3. I think, thats not just "hot air"<br>akinn [3k]~wasnt it rather the mainstream west that objectd against rammstein?<br>SamSpade [3d]I bet he likes Labach<br>PepperX [7k]I agree, not hot air at all, a real possibility.<br>SamSpade [3d]Laibach<br>LinuxGooo [7k]as a student I worked on the airbase Ramstein.<br>akinn [3k]~did you sell hotdogs?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]we had to do the annual inventory of the big ware houses<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Ramstein offers a fully "American life" to the US soldiers there. They can buy every kind of US product, you normally get in the US supermarkets. So on Ramstein airbase are also US supermarkets, you get everything<br>LinuxGooo [7k]We had to do the inventory check of the stocks in gigantic big warehouses. Its total crazy if you see it.<br>akinn [3k]~beatbox rammstein spin off<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I had a 2nd job, I sold in a rollin bakery shop (mini truck) all kind of Americna bakery and sweeties in the living area of the US soldiers, Mostly I sold donuts :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And the kids loved a lot to buy sweeties, of course all in US dollars. Smurfs, white mice, lollipops etc. ..... was my Saturday job to drive aroundwith this bakery truck, and stop every 300 meters, ringing with a bell like Santa Clause, and see the little kids of US soldiers running to buy for some US cents their sweeties.<br>akinn [3k]~probably by the sheer symbolism eg less politically correct even..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So I got a little insight into the life of US soldier families on Ramstein. Its impressive huge.<br>akinn [3k]~but too boring to check it for real<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am worried ... dont know how to cope with my fears ... its hard to keep up daily life.

It already has escalated.<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re saying that, they"ve been doing this stuff since forever<br>akinn [3k]~sort of the nato army mercenaried the ukrain<br>okiol [1k]it"s really messed up, but it"s unfortunately the reality we live in<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Lavrov clearly stated, that herewith, Russia has the right to attack also those countries, who deliver these weapons indirectly.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I must say: Russia is right with it.<br>okiol [1k]the point of such statements isn"t to explain why they"re going to attack, it"s to deter people from helping ukraine<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re not right lol<br>akinn [3k]~if the west had wanted an agreement the minsk accord had worked<br>okiol [1k]have you forgotten there is no good justification for russia invading ukraine in the first place?<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia doesn"t have a right to nuke us, linux<br>PepperX [7k]Hello fallowseed. Do you know what ORGAN2/ASLSP is?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But Lavrov is not a stupid guy, I think he already knows, that NATO and US army wont stop.

We are no more in the "Cold war era". or Europe looked away and kept silent, when Russia occupied the Crimean Peninsula. Now Europe as such is involved in a war against Russia. Not just on standby anymore.<br>okiol [1k]i am talking about this situation<br>akinn [3k]~the powers that be dont want an agreement so europe will be stuck in this mire until it escalates still further<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think, its wrong to ignore the warnings from Russia side. Just saying: In the past they just had some loud words, all hot air. Thats very naive that way.<br>okiol [1k]i"m not talking about ignoring, like i"ve already stated<br>okiol [1k]my problem is that you"re ignoring facts of what has already happened and is currently happening<br>okiol [1k]so it"s rather just the opposite<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin now is 69. So just by aging, he runs out of time. He needs some success to write something into Russia"s history books.<br>okiol [1k]literally in this situation as we"re speaking, the only reason russia is able to more or less fight ukraine 1v1 is that they have the nuclear threat, in this very war they have threatened aggression against countries that want to help ukraine and send stuff their way, and it has worked<br>okiol [1k]this is already happening, right now. We know this. It is not a cause for speculation<br>akinn [3k]~it is not about needing succes, but about, hopefully with full long term effects solving the situation of encrouchment on russia (and other countries like china africa pakistan india etc.)<br>akinn [3k]~if he has as much or a little more of donbass on 9th<br>akinn [3k]~that is easy t o sell as at least a partial militry succes<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But this time Russia"s military strategy fails, okiol. Its obvious, that Russia cant win this war by a non-atomic strategy. Even the 2nd attempt now of a "big offensive" already failed. All military experts say so, that Russia wont be successful. I think, Putin knows this already, so all what he has is tactical nuclear missiles to turn the game.<br>okiol [1k]that"s another topic, but you"re wrong there as well<br>akinn [3k]~talking speculation about russias motives i dont see much sanity at all<br>okiol [1k]russia is currently winning in the east<br>okiol [1k]they can"t take all of ukraine though<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I hope I am wrong .... of course I am not a military expert. I just try to bring this crazy puzzle together and hope I find the right interpretation for my own life.<br>okiol [1k]russia is still stronger than ukraine, there is no doubt of that<br>okiol [1k]right, but what military experts are you listening to?<br>D<br>Qkannone [6k]<br>PepperX [7k]<br>akinn [3k]~point is nato already announced ukrain would return to the east with an offensive at a later died<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I listen to former Gnerals (of German army), Professors at Universities who are experts about war history and war strategies etc. ....<br>okiol [1k]anyone saying russia has no chance of any military success at all is a propagandist, and is not mainly speaking as an objective arbiter of truth<br>akinn [3k]~so any progress towards peace or settlement is precluded beforehand<br>okiol [1k]they have already gotten a lot of military success<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What I understood, that after the retreat in Northern part, and re-organising Russia<br>okiol [1k]right, we can count that part as a win for ukraine, i agree there<br>okiol [1k]they were unable to do as much as they originally wanted<br>LinuxGooo [7k]... re-organisating Russia"s army for the Donbass offensive, that Russian army with its heavy atillery setup a front line of 400 kilometers. But experts say, that this huge length cant be successful. Russia already fails to deliver enough support for (fuel, munition etc. ...)<br>PepperX [7k]And then there is the bigger picture. What relationship does the USA have with DPRK? Iran?<br>akinn [3k]~europe could occupy trnasnestria, and if it were with the intention of peace explicit , perhaps even without putin would hardly mind<br>akinn [3k]~but i dont want that , because moldavia would not want that<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So this 2nd offensive didnt go so quickly as planned. This gives now Ukraine enough time to get the heavy atillery weapons (Howitz from Canada etc. ....) to fight the Russian army from long distance.<br>SamSpade [3d]would be funny if Iran and the US was secretly on the same side all along<br>PepperX [7k]Right, and then Putin will double down (increase his offensive).<br>akinn [3k]~well settle it in the sense for 15 years for sure and perhaps 30 yrs at least would mean transnistria realligns strategically with moldova<br>okiol [1k]i don"t know whether russia will manage to take all of donbas, honestly i don"t keep up enough with the details to have any opinion of that, but they are already controlling quite large parts of it<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Some experts say, that Putin has to demonstrate some success on 9th May, the big celebratoin of Russia"s "Victory Day". Putin cant have nothing in hands.<br>PepperX [7k]And millions of refugees<br>okiol [1k]controlling with a military force and it being actual russian territory long-term are two different things though, idk<br>PepperX [7k]and how many dead? A lot.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia already postponed some elections which had been planed for September, because the government fears that some "social nerviousity and anger" might have negative influence onto the election results. So this shows, that Putin is already kind of "nervious". He needs something to show to the population which at least looks like a victory.<br>PepperX [7k]Suppose Putin drops/sends tactical nuclear weapon(s) on Ukraine. So what"s going to happen?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Now all the heavy weapons are flooding Ukraine next weeks/months ... that wont make it easier for the Russian army to have some bigger success. The gunners of Ukraine atilery are very precise, as Drone footages show. They knock out lots of heavy Russian atillery these days.<br>PepperX [7k]More UN talk talk talk (or blah blah blah as you know who said)? That does a lot of good.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Putin should drop nuclear missiles, then I fear, that USA is not shy to throw a nuclear bomb onto Moscow.<br>PepperX [7k]Hmmmmmm........I don"t think so, but maybe.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What Putin can do is before using nuclear weapons, that he attacks with biological and chemical weapons to escalate the war onto a next level.<br>PepperX [7k]Send Nuke to Moscow would start the end of the world.<br>PepperX [7k]Yes, definitely. Chem, Bio.<br>akinn [3k]~at least they warend usa (and even england) about their perception of the complicity of these in arming up ukraine for 8 yrs preparing this war<br>SamSpade [3d]if Putin started using nukes then pretty much every country in the would would try to assassinate him<br>PepperX [7k]Maybe.

Already her father was a minister.<br>akinn [3k]~ministries wever<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So she grew up from little to learn how to move successfully in the world of diplomacy.<br>PepperX [7k]if you see a bright flash, don"t go to the window to look. If it is a nuke, the blast wave comes a second or two later.<br>akinn [3k]~wlel as i said she could better understand the russians, but she wont easily<br>akinn [3k]~and if she ever wished and sincerely would i doubt , sorry<br>akinn [3k]~too many have the interest of being in the 1%<br>akinn [3k]~anything that happens is a profit<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Under Merkel she was Minister for labour (2009-2013), then MInister for Defense (2013-2019) and MInister for family affairs (2005-2009). Honestly I have no respect for such people who jump around in very different fields of competences in highest positoins. For me such people are just "show makers".<br>akinn [3k]~well i think she hates war, perhaps she stays human<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The professoinal background von der Leyen has, that she studied medicine.<br>Epsilion [3k?]right LG<br>akinn [3k]~she is okay at being a force in the unity of europe<br>PepperX [7k]To see the effect of a nuke, this is website: https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap but you need to know where your country"s stock piles are because most likely, "the enemy" will strike there: https://blog.batchgeo.com/nuclear-locations-worldwide<br>akinn [3k]~fine, i mean whatcan i say<br>akinn [3k]~workable before this war<br>akinn [3k]~compliment<br>LinuxGooo [7k]She knows to move around in this political world to secure her own carrier. She has huge self discipline to avoid bigger conflicts with anybody. And never forget to smile as much as possible front camera.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]In my undersanding a politician should not have the skills of a Poker player. Thats for me not authentic. I dont have trust in such people.<br>PepperX [7k]LinuxGooo, me, the opposite. Those who sit in one place their whole life have limited experience. What I have seen, is that the really talented people who have diverse skills -- we need that! -- work different positions for a few years, and learn much from each position.<br>akinn [3k]~i only know her in her current function, she started a bit awkward perhaps, sholtz also , well maybe it is shy, keeping a somewhat low profile ,and in most respect grew with the task<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have also two jobs, yes ... follow the princips of th ebook of 5 rings written by Samurei Musashi. Train yourself in many fields, e.g. poetry, gardening, painting etc. .....<br>LinuxGooo [7k]but become also a master ....<br>LinuxGooo [7k]that takes 20-30 years to master a profession. It needs time to have the experience.<br>PepperX [7k]I listened to the UN yesterday, or 12hours ago. Talk talk talk. I listened to the Ru prepresentative, and what he said was so different from what most others said. But, I don"t think it matters. Only weapons matter.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]10 years being a doctor in medicine, and then for 6 years a minister of defense, and then a president of European parliament and so on... thats a joke.<br>PepperX [7k]20 - 30 years to become a master?! No! I became of ECR chat in only a few weeks!<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Such a person only has learnt one thing: Nice, diplomatic talking, but never being competent to have a real own opinion, always depending on so called "experts".<br>PepperX [7k]Oops! I mean, I became a master of ECR chat in only a few weeks.<br>akinn [3k]~wouldnt these work out the same?<br>PepperX [7k]No! It is important to use the expertise of others!!<br>PepperX [7k]Compare with the former evil emperor of the US who didn"t listen to experts.<br>akinn [3k]~we++ ot os a good thing and a show of talent, but indeed not enough to rely on with any and every decission alone<br>LinuxGooo [7k]but you need the ability to judge what experts tell you. Expert A tells you that the solutoin XY is the best, Expert B tells you that the solutoin WZ is the best. And now as minister you shall decide, if 200 billion Euro shall be spent for XY or WZ solution. Thats not possible.<br>akinn [3k]~nehow she doesnt deal with things like that but uses lots of feedback and backups so she was probably picked for her talents rather than her limitations<br>LinuxGooo [7k]You need to be competent in the field you represent as boss.<br>PepperX [7k]Generalism is a field.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Von der Leyen got the job from the former minister of defense to modernize the German army. She completly failed with this task.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]One thing is to take then 20 million in hands just for "writing some strategy papers" by the so called experts ... the other thing is to understand what is said in such stratgegy papers.<br>akinn [3k]~and thats why they can now give away a 100 modern aa inventory<br>PepperX [7k]I thought the German army had these ultra-high tech tanks?<br>akinn [3k]~and panzerfasut 3 and 4<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If one of us would fail in a big concern, lets say Siemens or Google or AirFrance to get the job as top manager, to modernize this concern, and then fail ... the carreer would end forever. But Von der Leyen just smiles, and jumps on to the next big job as EU president. What comedy is that ?<br>PepperX [7k]i think most effective is integrated cyberwarefare with chem and bio and nuke.<br>PepperX [7k]And hi tech rifles.<br>PepperX [7k]shoulder launched missiles, and drones.<br>akinn [3k]~the thing , geppard, was designed with russian columns in mind, theyw ont be happy<br>LinuxGooo [7k]People should learn to communicate, listen to each other and talk with each other, and not wasting time to engineer mines, drones, missiles. Human race invests into the wrong assets. Its so stupid.<br>akinn [3k]~curious how my 70s flakpanzers will perform their 88s<br>LinuxGooo [7k]you know ... today I googled about this "Gepard", I had no idea what popped up in Google Images.<br>PepperX [7k]Personnel in orange hazmat suits march during a paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang in this undated image supplied by North Korea"s Korean Central News Agency on September 9, 2021.https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/nkorea-puts-hazmat-suits-on-parade-for-national-day-but-no-missiles-ldgltges<br>akinn [3k]~they are also capable of intercepting big missiles<br>akinn [3k]~not with a 100% succes rate but a chance<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I said: Oh, I know that "double canon box", I glued it together as child. The basic concept of this Flak tank was developed in the 60s and 70s. So as kid I built such tank models, glued the pieces together with plastic glue, painted it, and then stick on it the symbols of German army.

It"s just important to avoid too cringey and potentially harmful takes with it...<br>Kingu [-]*reminded that I was supposed to look stuff upon sufism*<br>okiol [1k]but also like maybe not everybody have to be these post-enlightenment perfectly understanding of every social issue and how it all fits together in the different relationships between people and stuff, i"m not sure<br>okiol [1k]what are you interested in wrt sufism?<br>Kingu [-]just basic stuff, when,where, what, who<br>okiol [1k]:D<br>Kingu [-]I"m trying to improve myy knowledge of the history of the Muslim world<br>Kingu [-]and seeing how it was "opposed" to integrists interpretations of Islam, I became curious about it<br>okiol [1k]i haven"t checked out the arabic branch, but this guy"s stuff is generally high quality in terms of scholarship, and i know he has a special interest in arabic philosophy, so maybe something of interest here! it"s a resource one could use, anyway https://historyofphilosophy.net<br>Kingu [-]oh yes, I remember<br>okiol [1k]i personally think the indian branch is very underwhelming for a podcast called "... without gaps", but anyway<br>okiol [1k]whatever is there should at least be good<br>Kingu [-]I"ll get the book, I think<br>Kingu [-]I already have two<br>okiol [1k]oh right, maybe you talked about buying them before<br>Kingu [-]I know we talked about this guy<br>okiol [1k]i hope he drastically expands on the indian branch tbh, it"s kind of embarrassing that he spends significantly more time on the 13th-14th century european phil than all of india"s phil<br>okiol [1k]i wonder what he"s gonna do with buddhism as well, since realistically it will grow beyond the boundaries of any single branch<br>okiol [1k]would make sense to treat it like he treated africana phil kind of, but then his branches start breaking apart :D<br>Kingu [-]I would imagine he needs help from other scholars<br>okiol [1k]yes, he did receive help from other scholars<br>Kingu [-]for those topics he isn"t as well versed in<br>Kingu [-]it"s a bit like ReligionForBreakfast on YouTube<br>dronin [?]sorry d/c<br>Kingu [-]he has expanded into Buddhism<br>dronin [?]he said something about that something in the muslim religion discourages scientific thinking, hence the "big absence" from a culture that already gave so much in the past (algebra, etc)<br>Kingu [-]mmh<br>okiol [1k]but idk, it just seems weird to me. It seems a bit like typical modern western phil approach, where they"re trying their best to be global, but it"s still from such a western perspective, and they"re trying to kind of have it both ways, and it turns into this weird combination of being very western-centric, but attempting to be global, so that it looks like western phil has produced like 20x the amount that indian phil has<br>Kingu [-]I would think he has no clus about what he is saying<br>Kingu [-]I agree, okiol<br>okiol [1k]but hopefully this is like a weird missing link kind of period for philosophy and social sciences<br>Kingu [-]better than what it used to be, but still not perfect<br>okiol [1k]one option would"ve been to just go ok i just genuinely don"t know enough about those other things atm, so i"m gonna finish the western branch and do it really well, and this is going to be the western phil without gap podcast until further notice, and then maybe later we can branch out and do the other phils just as seriously as we did western phil<br>SamSpade [3d]did you ever read the article about native americans having an influence on the enlightenment?<br>SamSpade [3d]Kondiaronk<br>okiol [1k]i didn"t<br>Kingu [-]oh, I did, yes<br>SamSpade [3d]it was in french<br>SamSpade [3d]how was it?<br>Kingu [-]I remember having a few reservations<br>Kingu [-]in particular one big mistake in Rousseau"s biography, that was a bit red flagish<br>okiol [1k]the religion breakfast thing you mentioned kingu, is it something you recommend?<br>Kingu [-]I would, okiol, in particular the early Christianity stuff<br>Kingu [-]he probably has a play list<br>okiol [1k]sigh, christianity, here we go again :D<br>okiol [1k]i feel like i have a very weird relationship to it<br>Kingu [-](that"s because it"s his specialty)<br>okiol [1k]no i get it<br>okiol [1k]i just mean if it weren"t so historically important for the region i live in, i probably would take no notice of it... or maybe i"d be more genuinely curious about it as a viable option<br>okiol [1k]but now i just view it as something which i mainly just kind of have to learn more about to understand the history of europe and america<br>okiol [1k]but i"m sure there are a lot of great things there as well that i could appreciate if i just tried<br>Kingu [-]what I like is the formation of early Christianity, the hypotheses of what Hellenistic beliefs and philosophies contributed to it<br>Kingu [-]Sam, I"m trying to remember that point precisely, but it"s not coming back correctly ; but he was mentioning Rousseau among the people who used to have lived their lives surrounded by servants etc. ; which isn"t true for Rousseau, who in fact used to be a servant himself in his younger years<br>okiol [1k]ok, i"m reading some of that anyway<br>okiol [1k]actually you may know this name maybe<br>okiol [1k]because he only wrote in french<br>okiol [1k]pierre hadot, rings a bell?<br>Kingu [-]oh yes<br>Kingu [-]I have a few books of him<br>okiol [1k]a lot of his writings aren"t translated to english<br>okiol [1k]oh shit, do you have thoughts?<br>okiol [1k]specifically about hadot :P<br>Kingu [-]OK, I"m translating them right away just for you<br>okiol [1k]haha i"m good with what i have atm<br>okiol [1k]i think the books are already translated<br>okiol [1k]but he wrote a bunch of other stuff<br>SamSpade [3d]I remember seeing that point on twitter, kingu<br>Kingu [-]I have "what is ANcient Philosophy" and "Introductions to the Marcus AUrelius" Meditations"<br>Kingu [-]OK, Sam<br>okiol [1k]hm ok<br>Kingu [-]that"s what told me "maybe he didn"t check all that well, the formation of Enlightenment thinking"<br>SamSpade [3d]but Graeber is arguing that Rousseau lived in a hierarchal society<br>Kingu [-]OK<br>okiol [1k]i think understanding how unique and special aurelius" meditations is and how not like the others it is and exactly why is very interesting!<br>okiol [1k]i"m assuming he talks a lot about that in the intro<br>Kingu [-]he describes them as "spiritual exercises" and ANcient philosophy as something that had a practical purpose<br>okiol [1k]right<br>okiol [1k]practical, i"m not sure if it"s the perfect word choice, but i think i get your meaning<br>Kingu [-]I probably wouldn"t be able to remember much more right now<br>okiol [1k]i really like what i"ve read from hadot up until now, i think reading him as one starts to get into ancient phil would be a great option, like for a beginner<br>okiol [1k]because otherwise there"s so much potential for misunderstanding the context and what"s even the purpose of the texts one is reading<br>okiol [1k]like for example reading marcus aurelius as being a book about fear of death... or about it being some kind of prozylatizing<br>okiol [1k]when in actuality it"s more like a recording of aurelius" constant exercising in attempting to "program" himself to become more in line with the stoic principles so that he would live that way as well, a way of attempting to form his own thought patterns<br>Kingu [-]@Sam, another point I wasn"t convinced was about why Kondiaronk"s character in that French book were to be accepted as Kondiarink"s authentic words; it felt like he wasn"t giving much eveidence for that interpretation to be the better one<br>Kingu [-]maybe that"s true, but is it?<br>SamSpade [3d]possibly<br>okiol [1k]to what degree are we meant to believe that the native americans influenced the enlightenment?<br>SamSpade [3d]the eurocentric view would be to discount it<br>Kingu [-]European settlers, voyagers, were in contact with them, and might have brought back some of their ideas<br>Kingu [-]inshort<br>Kingu [-]at some point I saw a reddit comment on that book that I wanted to "investigate", I"m trying to find it<br>SamSpade [3d]there were a bunch of travelogues published in europe in the 17th century about meeting with native people<br>SamSpade [3d]some of the native tribes had flat hierarchal structures and tradition for reasoned debate<br>SamSpade [3d]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondiaronk<br>SamSpade [3d]this guy is alleged to have major influence on europe<br>okiol [1k]right, so if we take that as one example<br>okiol [1k]to my understanding, one of the most distinguishing features of the enlightenment is an extremely hierarchical way of thinking<br><br>DaoLin [3d]<br>SamSpade [3d]🏆<br>lot [1d]~<br>okiol [1k]<br>RoryDix [1k]💤<br>akinn [3k]~💤<br>Alex1888 [3k]<br>Yaruki [3k]<br>ChongHX [5k]<br>oziscimen [5k]🏅<br>stuie [5k]<br>dohduhdah [?]💤<br>hiss [-]💤<br>Kingu [-]<br>sheery [?]💤<br>sheeryjay [?]<br>yilapa [-]</td>

Could you give your comments on the following explanation of "doch"? These are my initial thoughts based on both this particular sentence and the tranlsations provided at http://www.dict.cc/?s=doch It is a difficult word and it could easliy be that I did not get it correctly.<br><br>First of all "doch" seams to me like a rude word. Not as bad as "f*" in English but still something that gives the sentence some ironic, haughty scent. If you want to be polite and respectful you wouldn't use it. And if you want to show your superior position or knowledge then you would add the word "doch".<br><br>Das können Sie nicht tun! - You cannot do that; polite form, talking to strangers<br><br>Das kannst du nicht tun! - You cannot do that; still good and polite form if you are talking to your friend.

Stelter asked the panel, which included the New York Times' Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, European Commission VP Věra Jourová, Rep. Seth Moulton, and Internews CEO Jeanne Bourgault.<br><br>"If you look at this question of disinformation," Sulzberger replied, "I think it maps basically to every other challenge that we're grappling with as a society, and certainly the most existential among them."<br><br>"What it attacks is trust," he continued, suggesting that a lack of trust will result in the disintegration of society. "People fracture along tribal lines, and that immediately undermines pluralism, and the undermining of pluralism is probably the most dangerous thing that can happen to a democracy."<br><br>Sulzberger went on to claim that those who invoke terms such as "fake news" and "enemy of the people" were following in the footsteps of repressive regimes such as Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. He also contended that the information ecosystem had become poisoned to such an extent that it would require years of sustained effort to get things back on track.<br><br>(Excerpt) Read more at thepostmillennial.com ...<br><br>TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Culture/Society; Front Page News; News/Current Events<br>KEYWORDS: brianstelter; censorship; europe; freespeech; internet; misinformation; mrpotatohead; stelter; thepotato; wef<br>Dear FRiends, We need your help to get this FReepathon moving.<br>Your loyal support makes Free Republic possible.
