What makes up a person? Ever hear someone say, "he has his mother's eyes" or "he has his father's hairline"? Well, that comes from something called DNA and that's what humans, and in fact nearly all life on earth is composed of. So, to be clear, you're saying "proud of something completely out of his control" as if it's untrue when everything he's referred to is 100% IN his DNA's control.<br><br>Cut the bullshit "you didn't have anything to do with that" when people refer to their ancestors and extended families/tribes.

What was more amazing and eye opening was how everyone in the chatroom thought he was some white hill billy, they started calling him white racist names, and other white trash stereotypes.  It was amazing to see people who was against racism against black people being racist themselves.

As regards blacks, there was some assimilation going on there, too, as more blacks rose into the middle class and were able to benefit from better education which was previously more difficult for them to get. Most coherent nations are more ethnically homogeneous, but the U.S. has been an experiment to see if a homogeneity of political and social ideals could outweigh ethnic heterogeneity. In large part, it has been working, and is accelerating as blacks and legally-immigrated Hispanics are turning away from the anti-American regime currently occupying the White House and holding a majority in the Congress. <br>-- Culture and race are entangled issues, difficult to disentangle. There is a lot of overlap, because of the geographical correlation between origins of cultures and races. Traditions and customs change slowly. And given the way human brains work, a lot of associations that underpin stereotypes can seem to be validated by observation, despite errors in causal reasoning. It's easy for people to move from "this group of people tends to behave in this way" to "this group of people is necessarily and genetically bound to behave in this way." <br>-- Collectivist thinking makes matters worse, and collectivism is a necessary assumption of racism. Add in some postmodernism, a philosophical approach that disclaims the possibility for objective truth, and degrades the notion of truth to either feelings or some groups propaganda, and the stage is set for third- and fourth-wave feminism, CRT, and other ideologies that fervently attach themselves to untruths and irrationality. <br>-- Few people have been able to get the education to sort out the philosophical, psychological, and ideological issues explicitly, and the leftward slide of educational institution has resulted in a couple of generations that are mostly intellectually corrupted. The wonder is that there remains some good will among races.<br><br>11<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago<br> @keiko909  aka the truth<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>Fandrie Koh<br>2 days ago<br> @billybobbananas  jokes aside, my chinese mil had a big lump removed from her jaw by a black surgeon when doctors told her that there are terrible risks of nerve damage and her face sagging ... he removed it and aside from a slight asymmetry when she smiles, her facial muscles are all intact.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago (edited)<br>blacks think they are so cool and so special and they actually think we think they are cool and special and worship them, when it is the exact opposite and we don't want to be near them and flee when they inevitably always follow us, access to whites is not a right, LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE!!! don't they claim to hate us and that we oppress them? so why do they follow us everywhere and barge in<br><br>26<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago (edited)<br> @Fandrie Koh  a black doctor here in Canada almost killed my friend by cutting his liver in half when he was supposed to work on his gall bladder or pancreas(can't remember which)..they are not as smart, skilled or dedicated as whites on the macro average, and by a huge margin, they also get affirmative action(anti-white racism) that lowers the standards and passes them when they are incompetent and inept<br><br>19<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago<br> @grizzlygrizzle  lmfao, the hijacked west are the bully tyrant aggressor invaders not China and Russia<br><br>8<br><br><br><br>Fandrie Koh<br>2 days ago<br> @Ethan Mac  my point is, as much as we like to use stats to justify racial stereotypes and judgement of ethnic groups, those stats cannot predict an individual's ability/skills or personality because individuals vary wildly from statistical median.
