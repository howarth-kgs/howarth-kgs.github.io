The Court writes that “what constitutes contempt, as well as the time during which it may be committed, is a matter of local law.” Leaving undecided the question of whether First Amendment guarantees are applicable to the states via the 14th Amendment, the Court holds that the free speech and press guarantees only guard against prior restraint and do not prevent “subsequent punishment.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 15, 1917<br>CONGRESS PASSES THE ESPIONAGE ACT<br>Congress passes the Espionage Act, making it a crime “to willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States,” or to “willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentOct 01, 1917<br>THE CIVIL LIBERTIES BUREAU IS FORMED IN RESPONSE TO PASSAGE OF THE ESPIONAGE ACT<br>The Civil Liberties Bureau, a forerunner of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is formed in response to the passage of the Espionage Act.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentMay 16, 1918<br>CONGRESS PASSES THE SEDITION ACT<br>Congress passes the Sedition Act, which forbids spoken or printed criticism of the U.S. government, the Constitution or the flag.<br><br>History of the First Amendment1919<br>SCHENCK V.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes writes that “the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas—that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.” This passage forms the foundation of the “marketplace of ideas” theory of the First Amendment.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJan 19, 1920<br>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION IS FOUNDED<br>Roger Baldwin and others start up a new organization dedicated to preserving civil liberties called the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).<br><br>History of the First AmendmentMar 03, 1921<br>CONGRESS REPEALS THE SEDITION ACTS<br>Congress repeals the Sedition Actsof 1918.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentDec 25, 1921<br>PRESIDENT WARREN HARDING COMMUTES EUGENE DEBS’ SENTENCE<br>President Warren Harding commutes Eugene Debs’ sentence to time served.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 08, 1925<br>GITLOW V.

Justice Louis Brandeis writes in his concurring opinion a passage that becomes a fundamental First Amendment principle: “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” Whitney was pardoned on June 27th by California Governor Clement Calhoun Young.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentNov 19, 1928<br>NEW YORK EX REL.

Pacifica, the Court allows FCC regulation because the broadcast media are a “uniquely pervasive presence” and easily accessible to children. The Court, however, does make clear that, although the government can constitutionally regulate indecent speech in the broadcast media, it does not have power to enforce a total ban on such speech.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 20, 1980<br>CENTRAL HUDSON GAS & ELECTRIC CORP. V. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF NEW YORK<br>In Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation v. Public Service Commission, the Supreme Court sets forth a four-part test for determining when commercial speech may or may not be regulated by states. The test states that: (1) the commercial speech must not be misleading or involve illegal activity; (2) the government interest advanced by the regulation must be substantial; (3) the regulation must directly advance the asserted government interest; and (4) the government regulation must not be more extensive than is necessary to serve the government interest at stake.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJul 02, 1980<br>RICHMOND NEWSPAPERS, INC., ET AL.

V. PICO, BY HIS NEXT FRIEND PICO, ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court rules in Board of Education v. Pico that school officials may not remove books from school libraries because they disagree with the ideas contained in the books. The Court states that “the right to receive ideas is a necessary predicate to the recipient’s meaningful exercise of his own rights of speech, press, and political freedom,” and makes clear that “students too are beneficiaries of this principle.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJul 02, 1982<br>NEW YORK V. FERBER<br>The Supreme Court rules in New York v. Ferber that child pornography is not protected by the First Amendment.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJul 02, 1982<br>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE ET AL. V.

MYERS<br>The Supreme Court rules in Connick v. Myers that the First Amendment rights of a former assistant district attorney were not violated when she was dismissed for distributing a questionnaire criticizing workplace practices. The case, along with the Court’s 1968 Pickering decision, forms the basis of much public-employee First Amendment law.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentAug 11, 1984<br>CONGRESS PASSES THE EQUAL ACCESS ACT<br>Congress passes the Equal Access Act. The federal law prohibits secondary schools that are receiving federal financial assistance from denying equal access to student groups on the basis of religious, political or philosophical beliefs or because of the content of their speech.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentFeb 25, 1985<br>CITY OF RENTON ET AL. V. PLAYTIME THEATRES, INC., ET AL<br>The Supreme Court upholds a zoning law regulating the location of adult businesses. The Court determines in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. that the law does not discriminate on the basis of the expression of the adult businesses because it focuses on the harmful secondary effects allegedly associated with such businesses.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJul 07, 1986<br>BETHEL SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 403 ET AL. V. FRASER, A MINOR, ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court case Bethel School District v. Fraser curtailed the protections established in the Tinker case. Bethel School District in Spanaway, Wash., suspended 17 year old Matthew Fraser, an honors student, for two days after what was considered a lewd spring election campaign speech at a school assembly with 600 students present. His candidate won. However, the courts held that the manner of speech, delivered before a captive audience, rather than the content, was disruptive and contrary to the values the school intended to promote.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 01, 1987<br>TURNER ET AL. V. SAFLEY ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court upholds a Missouri regulation limiting inmates’ mail correspondence, while striking down a regulation prohibiting inmates from marrying. The Court in Turner v. Safley establishes the following standard in inmate cases: “when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is ‘reasonably related’ to legitimate penological interests.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJan 13, 1988<br>HAZELWOOD SCHOOL DISTRICT ET AL. V. KUHLMEIER ET AL.<br>In Hazelwood School District v.

FLYNT V. JERRY FALWELL<br>In Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, Hustler Magazine publishes a parody of a liquor advertisement in which televangelist Jerry Falwell is depicted in a lewd manner. A unanimous Supreme Court rules that a public figure must show that actual malice was committed by a publication in order to recover money for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court rules that political cartoons and satire “have played a prominent role in public and political debate.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 21, 1989<br>TEXAS V. JOHNSON<br>In Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court rules that burning the American flag is a constitutionally protected form of free speech.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentOct 28, 1989<br>CONGRESS PASSES THE FLAG PROTECTION ACT<br>Congress passes the Flag Protection Act. The act punishes anyone who “knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any U.S. flag …”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 11, 1990<br>UNITED STATES V. SHAWN D. EICHMAN, DAVID GERALD BLALOCK AND SCOTT W. TYLER<br>The Supreme Court in United States v. Eichman invalidates the Flag Protection Act of 1989.

LORAIN JOURNAL CO. ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court determines in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal that there is no wholesale exemption from libel for all statements alleged to be opinions.

SULLIVAN<br>The Supreme Court in Rust v. Sullivan upholds a federal program that prevents those receiving federal funding for reproductive health services from discussing abortion as a method of family planning. The Court explains: “The Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another way.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentDec 10, 1991<br>SIMON & SCHUSTER, INC.

Members of the New York State Crime Victims Board, the Supreme Court invalidates the New York Son of Sam law that requires accused or convicted persons to turn over to the state proceeds from any work describing their crimes.

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU rules that the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996 is unconstitutional. The Court concludes that the act, which makes it a crime to display indecent or patently offensive material on the Internet where a child may find it, is too vague and tramples on the free speech rights of adults.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentMay 18, 1998<br>ARKANAS EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION COMMISSION V. RALPH P. FORBES<br>In Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, the Supreme Court rules that a public television station’s exclusion of a political candidate from its televised debate does not violate the First Amendment.

V. VOPPER, AKA WILLIAMS, ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court rules in Bartnicki v. Vopper that a federal law prohibiting the publication of illegally intercepted wire communications violates the First Amendment rights of those who published the communications, though they were not the ones who intercepted them.

V. JOHN D. ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL<br>The Supreme Court rejects constitutional challenges, including one based on the First Amendment, to the Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended the copyright protection term by 20 years.

BARRY ELTON BLACK, RICHARD J. ELLIOT, AND JONATHAN O’MARA<br>The Supreme Court rules in Virginia v. Black that a state law banning cross-burning largely passes constitutional muster.

LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court rejects a First Amendment based challenge to a government program that called for mandatory assessments from beef producers to fund generic advertising.

ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL V. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ET AL.<br>The Supreme Court upholds a lower court’s preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act. The Court reasons in Ashcroft v. ACLU II that “filtering software is an alternative that is less restrictive than COPA, and, in addition, likely more effective as a means of restricting children’s access to materials harmful to them.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentMay 30, 2006<br>GIL GARCETTI, ET AL. V. RICHARD CEBALLOS<br>In Garcetti v. Ceballos a divided Supreme Court held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 25, 2007<br>DEBORAH MORSE, ET AL.

Frederick, the Supreme Court rules that principal Deborah Morse did not violate the First Amendment rights of high school student Joseph Frederick when she punished him for displaying a “Bong Hits 4 Jesus” banner on a public street directly across from his school while the Winter Olympic Torch Relay passed through Juneau, Alaska. The Court creates a “drug speech” exception to the Court’s landmark student speech case, Tinker v.

PHELPS<br>In Snyder v. Phelps, the Westboro Baptist Church picketed on public land one thousand feet from the funeral of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder with signs that read “Fags Doom Nations,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “Thank God for Dead Soldiers.” Snyder’s father sued under state civil law, including for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the picketing was protected expression.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 27, 2011<br>BROWN V. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION<br>In Brown v. Entertainment Merchants, a group of video game and software companies filed a pre-enforcement challenge to a California law restricting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the companies and found that the games qualified for First Amendment protection, noting that like “the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas . . . through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world).”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentApr 02, 2014<br>MCCUTCHEON V. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION<br>In McCutcheon v. FEC, Shaun McCutcheon challenged a federal campaign law, known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which limited individuals to $48,600 in contributions to candidates and $74,600 in contributions to political parties, with an aggregate cap of $123,200. The Supreme Court ruled that the aggregate limit unconstitutionally hindered political speech and did not curb corruption, the stated purpose of the act. <br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 19, 2017<br>MATAL V. TAM<br>In Matal v. Tam, The Slants were denied a trademark for their band’s name by the Patent and Trademark Office, citing the Disparagement Clause of the Lanham Act of 1946 and the rationale that the name may be disparaging towards “persons of Asian descent.” Simon Tam appealed the decision. The Supreme Court ruled that the clause violated the First Amendment. In his opinion, Justice Alito reasoned that the clause constituted viewpoint discrimination and said that “speech may not be banned on the grounds that it expresses ideas that offend.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 04, 2018<br>MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP V. COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION<br>In Masterpiece, after a religious baker refused to bake a cake for a wedding between two men, the couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging discrimination.

The baker took his case to the Supreme Court, where he won by a 7–2 margin, but on very narrow grounds.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJun 24, 2019<br>IANCU V. BRUNETTI<br>In Iancu v. Brunetti the owner of the clothing brand “FUCT” was granted the right to register his brand name, invalidating the Lanham Act’s ban on the registration of “immoral” trademarks. The federal ban “distinguishes between two opposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional moral standards and those hostile to them; those inducing societal nods of approval and those provoking offense and condemnation. This facial viewpoint bias in the law results in viewpoint discriminatory application.”<br><br>History of the First AmendmentMar 15, 2020<br>THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC LEADS TO NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT EMERGENCY MEASURES AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT<br>Many officials have responded to COVID-19 with significant restrictions in the form of emergency stay-at-home orders, executive orders closing all but “essential” businesses, and bans on public gatherings — often of more than 10 people. Such measures have received pushback from church parishioners who want to worship together, business owners that want to re-open to avoid economic collapse, and persons who want to be able to assemble together either for communal, protesting, or other purposes.<br><br>History of the First AmendmentJul 06, 2020<br>BARR V.

Former US grand strategist Zbignew Brzezinski said: “It is IMPERATIVE that no Eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of also challenging America”. Because the US has just 4% of the world’s population, and it’s isolated from the Eurasia continent which has 70% of the world’s population, or 87% with Africa included. Defensively, it’s an advantage to the US, but economically, it’s a handicap. That’s why economically, Eurasia is a competitor to the US and the Euro is a threat to the dollar. <br>How does the US with an isolated and just 4% of world’s population maintain its position as the world’s biggest economy? The dollar must stay as the world’s reserve currency. This allows the size of the US economy to be highly scaled up, instead of being sized according to the fundamentals.<br><br>To be the world’s reserve currency, the dollar must be circulated in the world. The US created a huge consumption-based economy and shifted manufacturing outside, so that dollars flow out of the US to product suppliers like China or Japan. To make products, China and Japan need energy. The US created the Petrol-dollar scheme, so that dollar is circulated to Saudi. With the US stock and financial market much more lucrative than other countries, the dollars from Saudi are attracted back to the US. Money printed in the US to exchange for goods from outside eventually ends up with the Wall Streets, where the rich gets richer. And that completes the cycle of circulation of the dollars. <br><br>The American Dream attracted top talents around the world to strengthen the US’ science and technology sectors, and a technological gap is maintained between the US and other major economy like China, so that the US benefits from highly lucrative high-tech product/patent exports, while low profit manufacturing sector is outsourced to China and Vietnam. This is why world leader in 5G, Huawei, are banned in 2019.<br><br>If China or Japan bring back all the dollars and exchange to their local currencies, it inflates the local currencies, making their exports expensive. So, China and Japan use some of the dollars to buy US debts (treasury bonds). That’s why the US, a rich country, is in-debt to China which has just 1/5th of the US’ GDP per capita.<br><br>And by holding US treasury bills, China and Japan have to support the US dollar, for if the US dollar collapses, their hard earn money would become worthless. After Obama’s “Pivot to Asia” in 2011, which aimed to contain China, China introduced the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) in 2013 and diverted some of the dollars into it to reduce the risk of putting all eggs in one basket, and hoping that after these countries are developed, China would have a wider trade market. <br><br>With a huge population, if Asia and Africa develop rapidly, the share of the US’ economy shrinks, then the Euro could replace it as the world’s reserve currency. When that happens, the US would no longer be able to print money out of nothing without a hyper inflation like Venezuela. Then the size of the US economy has to fall back to the fundamentals, which today is quite a lot smaller than the inflated economy. That’s why no country in Eurasia is allowed to catch up with the US’ economy. When Japan was catching up fast on the US in the 1980s, they were knocked down to a three decade stagnancy by appreciating the Japanese Yen. And in the last 30 years, the US created conflicts, wars and color revolutions in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa to destabilise the Eurasia-Africa supercontinent. <br><br>When the US prints a lot of money, other countries’ foreign reserves in dollars shrink in value. Furthermore, to prevent exports to the US becoming expensive, these countries have to print money too, which devalues the savings of the people, and causing inflations in these countries. It’s estimated that our savings devalue by 6-9% per year after the abolishment of the gold-backed Bretton Woods system, after which the US prints money based on just the creditability of the dollar.<br><br>North America is relatively easy to defend, yet the US has a military budget more than the total of the next 9 countries in the top 10, to protect the dollar with its 800 military bases worldwide. <br><br>For the record, the US had no mercy on threats to the dollar:<br>* In 2000 Saddam Hussein said he would start selling oil in Euros not Dollars. <br>   >> Saddam was hanged by the US.<br>* In 2009 Gaddafi made Libya export oil in Gold Dinars, not in dollar or Euro. <br>   >> Gaddafi was killed by US-backed NTC.<br>* Syria had an independent Central Bank NOT under Federal Reserve controlled Bank of International Settlements. <br>   >> Obama attempted to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.<br>* Iran has been trading oil in currencies other than US dollars since 2011. <br>   >> Iran was being sanctioned by the US.<br>* After being sanctioned in 2014, Putin started to trade in non-dollar. In 2019, Putin (1) completely ditched dollars in oil trades, (2) sold almost all the US treasury bonds, (3) is now the forerunner in de-dollarization. <br>   >> The US tried to topple Putin by supporting Alexei Navalny. And now the Ukraine war to weaken Russia.<br>* China (1) introduced the BRI in 2013 which helps many countries to develop and speed up the integration of Eurasia, (2) used non-dollar in oil trades with Iran and Russia, (3) introduced the CIPS, an alternative to the West’s SWIFT system which has been weaponized by America, (4) China’s economy and high technology are catching up fast. <br>   >> China has become the US’ #1 target.<br><br>If a country supports the dollar, it’s being looted; if a country doesn’t support the dollar, the government is changed by the US. This is financial slavery.<br><br>The Fed has printed 80% of all US dollars in existence since Jan 2020. There was $4.02 trillion dollars in circulation at the beginning of 2020. The number reached $20.08 trillion by Oct 2021. This amounted to an astronomical 30 trillions debt. Coupled with a global rising urge to diversify into non-dollar reserves caused by the US’ sanctions to 39 countries, the dollar is in a creditability crisis. This is the major development which shapes geopolitics in the world today.<br><br>The US cannot have direct wars with Russia and China because they are nuclear armed. Proxy wars put the battlefields outside of the US, and the US would looked like an outsider. Remember in the 1980s, the US supported the Afghan Mujaheddin in a proxy war against the USSR. Russia and China have clearly defined their redlines. US would use its collaborators Zelensky and Tsai to push across the redlines to trigger the wars, and it would sell weapons to its allies in NATO and AUKUS, and get them to support the wars. <br><br>After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, US President Bill Clinton had two choices: (a) to integrate Russia into Europe and abolish NATO, OR, (b) to slowly alienate Russia to keep Russia and Europe divided. Clinton chose the latter, because if there’s no more Russia “threat”, there would be no more NATO to control Europe. As the first NATO Secretary General, Lionel Ismay described the military role of NATO: “To keep America IN, to keep Russia OUT, to keep Germany (Europe) DOWN”. NATO also allows the US to place missiles in Europe, so if a war break out in Europe, missiles would be flying between Moscow the East and Lisbon in the West, while the US remains safe across the Atlantic. <br><br>And politically, the EU is an American creation, as much as a European one. It’s much easier for Washington to control ruling elites at Brussels than having to control all politicians in Europe. The EU is used an ally or a sacrificial depending on the geopolitical needs of Washington.<br><br>The proxy war in Ukraine: 1.Divided Europe from Russia and divided Eurasia. 2.Killed Nord Stream II gas pipeline and German firm Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg has signed up for gas from America Venture Global LNG for 20 years. The US gained control over energy supply to Europe. 3.Created continuity for the Military Industrial Complex after pulling out of Afghanistan. 4.Most importantly, the war strengthened the dollar. Dollar against Euro is now the highest since NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia in Mar 1999 (happened two months after the official launch of Euro as the currency of the EU, which threatened the dollar). A strong dollar together with the Fed’s interest rise in 2022 cause capitals from all over the world to flow into the US’ economy, while collapsing other economies, like Sri Lanka.<br><br>Else where, two months after ignoring a warning from Washington against his visit to Moscow, highly popular Imran Khan was ousted from the PM post of Pakistan  on 9 Apr 2022. A month after ignoring Biden’s demand to increase oil production, secretary-general of OPEC, Mohammad Barkindo died unexpectedly on July 6 2022.<br><br>The US isn’t relinquishing its privilege to loot. Remember after WW II, Europe and Asia were devastated, but the US emerged as the world leader and the dollar became the world’s reserve currency.<br><br><br>Read more<br><br><br><br>@mariohelmie2965<br>2 months ago<br>Saying china while your country is the biggest nuclear build up the first on to use it and started it all....<br><br><br><br><br>@kfly5006<br>2 months ago<br>Why didn't we hear this about Palestine?<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>@ginebra7448<br>2 months ago<br>What is Proxy War?<br>Who Create Proxy War?<br><br><br><br><br>@solkalibri1376<br>1 month ago<br>Ukraine should have been a province of Russia and this war should not have happened.<br><br><br><br><br>@hoseadarrelvirry4336<br>2 months ago<br>it's country<br><br><br><br><br>@LS.....<br>2 weeks ago<br>Biden🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Unear<br><br><br><br><br>@ovauskhan8119<br>2 months ago<br>But not why not China... when China is flouncing encouraging!<br><br><br><br>@859Videos<br>2 months ago<br>Um....what's the war in the Middle East then<br><br>1<br><br><br>@user-yl6xp4jx3z<br>2 months ago<br>Been making videos and comments about how senile this guy is...
