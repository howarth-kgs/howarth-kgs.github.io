NATO is not sending an army, but NATO is fighting Russia with Ukrainian lives. If history is any guide, this war will go on for a long time. When a superpower invades and another superpower sends arms to the invaded country, the war goes on and on. The US invaded Vietnam and the Soviets supplied arms to Viet Cong. Similarly, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and US supplied missiles to Afghans. Both wars caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions displaced. This is a slow and ugly process. US and NATO's stated goal is "to weaken Russia" (Loyd Austin) instead of defending Ukraine, it is indeed a proxy war. Defending Ukraine is not the same thing as "to weaken Russia" a stated goal of the US and NATO.

Preppers have been doing this for years. They use the knowledge available to them to ensure that they can survive any contingency. Those that don't think about survival are doomed to die. Those that do think and talk about it, would be ready. <br><br>Admittedly, anyone who has not studied this subject before may find that it's too late to do much right now. It's not just about having the right equipment, but obtaining the skills needed to survive and then locating yourself somewhere that is unlikely to be affected by the results of the exchange. Follow the Boy Scouts motto - 'Be Prepared'.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Cletus Jones<br>2 weeks ago<br> @WOT Arty Noobs  I think the key to surviving nuclear war is being in a place where the bombs aren’t likely to fall. However a full on nuclear exchange would altar the climate so drastically I don’t think surviving would be very pleasant.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>Gx19 Films<br>2 weeks ago<br>Discuss it anyway<br><br><br><br><br>The General - World of Tanks Replays<br>2 weeks ago<br> @Cletus Jones  Correct.<br><br><br><br><br>The General - World of Tanks Replays<br>2 weeks ago<br> @SCPython  There is a subtle difference between Vietnam/Afghanistan and the Ukraine conflict. In both Vietnam and Afghanistan, the other side tolerated the arms supplied by the other without making nuclear threats. There were some who advocated bombing Haiphong harbor to sink Soviet supply vessels, but it was not carried out as it was too provocative. Similarly, the Soviets did not attack Pakistan for allowing the Mujaheddin receiving missiles from the Americans. <br><br>Russia did make it a Red Line event if NATO flew Polish MiG-29 into Ukraine airspace to supply the Ukrainian Air Force. Which is why despite the offers, this has not taken place. You are correct in that NATO is intending to 'bleed' Russia until they get tired and unable to continue. NATO intends to make Putin realize that the only way to avoid his forces being wiped out altogether is to withdraw them and declare that he has done all he needed to do - a Pyrrhic victory at best. If he refuses to withdraw, then his forces will do it for him when they are unable to continue and either surrender or mutiny.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Sam Young<br>2 weeks ago<br> @mnm mnm  someone sounds like they’re in denial<br><br><br><br><br>REVO 13<br>2 weeks ago<br>See Jason Robards in “The Day After”<br><br><br><br><br>quartermaster1976<br>2 weeks ago<br>It almost happened by mistake several times we almost blew each other up several times<br><br><br><br><br>George Einstein<br>2 weeks ago<br>Requirem for the American  Dream by Norm Chomsky  on Utube is a must for a very good understanding.<br><br><br><br><br>George Einstein<br>2 weeks ago<br> @Lone Ranger 22  Ukraine won't tolerate being the next Hong Kong.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>E Ekiane<br>2 weeks ago<br>😂😂😂 I thought I was the only 1.<br><br><br><br><br>E Ekiane<br>2 weeks ago<br> @Cletus Jones  we could put pressure on our politicians to stop arming Ukraine and find a peaceful solution.<br><br><br><br><br>colin powis<br>2 weeks ago<br>We lived under a cloud of nuclear war for so long that we became smug in our conceit that it could never happen , UNTIL IT DOES<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Frieda Conradie<br>2 weeks ago (edited)<br> @scotty3861  no it  will not happen it's not in bible prophecy!!!<br><br><br><br><br>The No Such Thing Podcast<br>11 days ago<br>Tell me about it.

Whether Russia deems this to be necessary depends entirely on Russia's threat perception, not yours, which is entirely irrelevant.

It was primarily a step to reassure the Russian domestic population that the invasion of Ukraine (the "special military operation") could be undertaken without risking a NATO war on Russia, given Russian nuclear weapon capabilities.<br><br>34<br>12<br><br><br>mbaxter22<br>2 weeks ago<br>Klare will be remembered as the lone voice in the wilderness who tried to prevent the great calamity and failed.

But what about the use of nukes against a non nuclear power? This is the real issue that we need to address. Would the Russian use of a small nuke in Ukraine result in WWIII? Should the US retaliate against Russia with a nuke if Russia used a nuke in Ukraine?<br><br>24<br>61<br><br><br>Cass<br>2 weeks ago<br>Somebody needs to show the films made in the 1980s to show what these weapons would do to people.

Nuclear war is no joke.<br><br>13<br>2<br><br><br>Geoffrey Reeks<br>1 day ago<br>Considering that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for a promise from the UK and from the USA to defend Ukraine from attack, it is disgusting beyond belief that the UK and the USA would say "We will not defend Ukraine". That brings immeasurable dishonor upon the UK and upon the USA. I (as an Australian) am reminded of Britain promising to defend Australia before World War II and then abandoning us when war came. Our response of the time was to develop chemical weapons in Homebush Bay, (Sydney) (the subsoil of which is still contaminated) and to develop biological weapons in the basement of the Wagga Wagga hospital. Similarly, small nations will now commence building biological, chemical and nuclear weapons for their own defense. Indonesia has announced that it will use its five nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons. Japan, has been building the precursors for their nuclear weapons and for their delivery systems for many years. It is now likely that Japan will make the final step and become a nuclear power. The damage from this UK and USA dishonor will last for a century. It will be the century of shame for the UK and for the USA. Millions of people will die needlessly as a result. Australian has invested more than 100 years in fighting with the UK and with the USA. If the UK and the USA will not honor a commitment in which Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons then Australia cannot rely upon the UK or upon the USA to help us. Any words that the UK or the USA might say in response are meaningless. The UK and the USA were honor bound to send troops to help Ukraine retrieve the Crimean Peninsula and other areas of Ukraine taken by Russia. The UK and the USA are too afraid that helping Ukraine as they promised would cause World War III. Yet, they made that promise to Ukraine in order to remove nuclear weapons from Ukraine and so reduce the risk of nuclear war.  Small nations, (such as Australia), cannot now rely upon the UK or upon the USA. There is also the looting of the Ukrainian treasury by corrupt Russian sympathetic politicians and Russian Plutarchs. Also there is the accusation that while President Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, he engaged in corrupt activities relating to the employment of his son Hunter Biden by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Of course, I do not know the truth of these reportedly corrupt activities. Though, they deserve to be investigated in the light of current events. Regards, Geoff. Reeks<br><br><br><br>Peter Bilski<br>12 days ago (edited)<br>I just finished watching this extremely important video. As self proclaimed scientist I MUST point to some very , very important mistake or omission in My Helfand reasoning. Not intended as critique, but as an advice because we are on the same side of the peacemaking expedition. So Mr Helfand call for abolishing nuclear weapons' world wide , without actually even mention the reason those exist and are still developing in first place. As a scientist I would like to point attention to the reason for those weapon to exist. In my opinion that is wide spread tolerance for military aggression , on the highest level possible. No country in the world could feel safe unless posses one of those nuclear weapons. So Mr Helfand, instead of just calling for ban of nuclear weapons  at United Nation level, we all need to call for ban on millenary aggression ! Yes ! Not just Russia military's aggression recently but all military intervention in the recent history beginning from WWII. Military aggression that is almost inbuild into superpowers program. If I wishes to be satirical in such tragic topic I would say New Amendment  written into constitution that given superpower must be engaged now in one or two military's conflicts constantly since WWII !!!. There is not a single condemnation in the speech above about conventionally conducted conflicts, intervention or war. Absolute tolerance on every level of UN , with UN nation even itself engaging in such activity < under very suspicious pretenses most of the time. This remark is not intended as a critique of those countries but as argument that lead us to main thesis here: WE NEED TO DECLEARE BAN ON MILITARY AGRESSION IN GENERAL. As consequences UN should then promote strict control of military budget as % of GDP of each country., Than APPLY SANCTION to those that do not obey, Then request program to steady decrease those expenses from commonly accepted 2% to 0.2% at the best or even less in the future. Countries should be advised to decrease their military might, but under some protection under UN promise instead. To illustrate even country in middle of Africa, hot spot  could minimize their army if all neighbors will be forced to do the same. Those that disobey UN will face strongest sanctions possible.  <br>Funds saved on military's expenses ( and those saved on damage inflicted by conflicts) could be then targeted to the subjects that really need humanity attention : climate, ecology degradation etc<br>Another serious mistake in the discussion above is assumption the main danger lay in nuclear weapons ( because they do extinguish whole humanity at once) . Misconception. For every human being there is only one life, one chance to live. Whey you die, The whole world die with you, for you. To see this level you need to rich a bit higher perspective of ant colony, humanity. When individual needs to scarify for the good of the rest. Not true at all. I can prove so but I doubt many could understand the logic. <br>But consequences are prefund. For example in this Ukrainian conflict the largest country on Earth could be grinded to powder using traditional, conventional weapons beside nuke at all . Then this fact do not rich our presenters at all . How the biggest country in the world could be now legally grinded for very suspicious pretense ( I am not taking sides in this or any other conflict!! I am against all conflicts and use of force !) The next is the most populous country on Earth that can be grinded also using traditional weapons . which will be totally legal under existing law and UN watch. How it is fair? That only illustrate that the smaller countries and nations have absolutely nothing to say in existing world if somebody for self interest decide to harm them or wipe of the map,.<br>At the end I would like to congratulate Dr. Michael Klare on common sense presented ability and I agree with him in most cases.<br><br>2<br><br><br>O Dem<br>13 days ago<br>Thanks for a great presentation, just one question, has any research been done on reversing a nuclear reaction so that a nuclear explosion is reversed or disabled in some way?<br><br>2<br>5<br><br><br>Cr Hu<br>2 weeks ago<br>1:15:10 the risk is higher because Russia has lost its strategic position since loss of Baltics Moldova and Ukraine, even assuming Belarus remains loyal.

Perhaps one day, in a new world with a new political reality, perhaps a post-nuclear world should we ever get there, but in the current climate and with current levels of human consciousness, it would be unlikely. Why is it then the case that so many western experts expect Russia to do this in respect of Ukraine and other former Soviet Republics, while the USA and its allies go around the world shooting up any country they please in their self defined role as global policeman? I welcome initiatives and attempts to ban and remove all nuclear weapons from all states, every sane person may hold this position. The deterrent policy of MAD makes use of nuclear weapons futile for humankind as a whole, not to mention all the other life forms on our shared planet. The problem here is that even such serious discussions as these are undermined by the participants maintaining a selective view of the current conflict in Ukraine where the Russians have a far more justifiable case for intervention than did the USA and its allies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and many other countries where they intervened. The lack of objectivity in this regard mitigates against the possibility of such people being capable of negotiating a nuclear free world treaty, because any agreement they would seek would only be acceptable to them where it allows for continued USA Hegemony.<br><br>7<br>5<br><br><br>Telum Atramenti<br>2 weeks ago<br>"Eliminating nuclear weapons" is certainly not a good long-term solution, because it will inevitably lead to prolonged, bloody conflicts with the use of the old trench warfare. Invading a country like Russia is a far worse nightmare than invading a country like the Afghanistan. Russian military doctrine is geared not towards establishing air superiority but rather denying air superiority to its opponents, with all types of surface to air, sea to air, handheld "Igla" type anti aircraft weapons, highly mobile and easily concealable through the "maskirovka" tactics Panzir SMs, "Shilkas", with a large number of inflatable decoys and "sleeper" snare radars. Given abundance of forested areas, limitation of maximum range for sea-based and EU landstrip based fighter jets and bombers, as well as Russia's ability to launch hypersonic and aeroballistic  missiles from deep within its own territory, severely stressing the already thin anti-missile defence installations. And we're not talking just one conflict, knowing our history as species we will slaughter each other in millions even billions unless and until there is a notion of some type of Mutually Assured Destruction. Can't live with it, and cannot live without it...<br><br>6<br>2<br><br><br>Hans Georg<br>2 weeks ago<br>This is an important topic. The only solution to the threat of nuclear war that I see is law and order on a global basis. We need to have laws that regulate the behavior between countries. We need also a military force that is able to enforce these laws on the global basis. The current international system cannot deliver on that regard. Therefore we seem to need a global government that controls all the nuclear weapons and has a monopoly on violence.<br><br>3<br><br><br>mcmxli1941<br>2 weeks ago<br>Yes, Hungary was encouraged to revolt in 1956, and NATO did not intervene.
