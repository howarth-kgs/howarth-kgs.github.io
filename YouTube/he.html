<td class="c s2em fSS bg2006SandDollar">Hench [1k]: Trying to imagine households surviving without infrastructure, not a good imagination, eating dandelions, chopping wood for the next season, preserving fruit and veg in extraordinary ways, using every part of an animal, etc, not for Average Joe.<br>Hench [1k]: Northern households that is, not Tropical Treehouses.<br>Hench [1k]: ))<br>Alex1888 [4k]: yeah<br>Hench [1k]: ))<br>Alex1888 [4k]: i would die<br>Alex1888 [4k]: maybe<br>Alex1888 [4k]: )<br>Hench [1k]: None of us can talk, except that we might build a goban in the forest clearing.<br>Alex1888 [4k]: haha<br>Hench [1k]: hey! Wanna play!? would be our spheel<br>Alex1888 [4k]: play on a tree stump in a forest<br>Alex1888 [4k]: the easiest way<br>Hench [1k]: you got it ))<br>Alex1888 [4k]: )<br>Hench [1k]: Why play?!? I got to find out the difference between Elk and Moose!＊<br>ericj [2k]: moose are bigger, browner, hairier, and have cupped antlers<br>RabidKyu [5k]: What does cupped mean?<br>ericj [2k]: their antlers have these large bowl-shaped portions. so I mean, in the form of a cup? <br>Hench [1k]: erm, made like a cup-shape, usually<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: in German we dont have a different meaning. Moose = Elk = Elch<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: so whats an Elk in American English ? And whats a Moose ?<br>Hench [1k]: Yes, I love the way Google gets a bit confused about the Deer Family.<br>Hench [1k]: then again, a 1-ton deer running around must be a sight to behold, whatever it is...<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: in German the male version of a deer is Hirsch, the female versoin we call Reh. But in ENglish its both the same, just "deer" ... <br>ericj [2k]: Deer, Moose, and Elk are separate species in English<br>Hench [1k]: No, we have Ro<br>Hench [1k]: for Reh<br>Alex1888 [4k]: well, the moose is just a double elk as i got it :)<br>Hench [1k]: The big male is called The Master<br>Hench [1k]: or Doh <br>ericj [2k]: well double size, plus the differences I elaborated, still has 4 legs and 2 eyes though :) <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: e.g. the Elks are those which run aroun din Canada. We dont have elks in Germany. We only have deers. <br>Alex1888 [4k]: oh<br>Alex1888 [4k]: really<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: sure .... <br>Alex1888 [4k]: but you have the word for it<br>Hench [1k]: Thing is, the deer will feed us all, if we cull them, or, we can let Wolves thrive, and they will eat a lot them<br>Alex1888 [4k]: so you had once :)<br>Hench [1k]: In Britain, since the wolf is not allowed, there is the problem of deers eating trees.<br>Alex1888 [4k]: no wolfs in Britain?<br>ericj [2k]: the reintroduction is a bit controversial here  in the US <br>Hench [1k]: Not<br>Hench [1k]: not allowed, too dangerous they say<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: e.g. we call all animals which can be shot and eaten living in the forrest "Wild" (German). E.g. we have "Schwarzwild" (e.g. black boars) and we have "Rotwild" (kind of "red furr type"), which are deers (female) and the masters. The male have big antlers and the female only very small antlers. <br>Hench [1k]: Which is strane, beause Scots people will walk to the top of mountains on 6 pints of pish, and never think about Wolf ambushes.<br>Alex1888 [4k]: wolf could make a sanitary function<br>Hench [1k]: Thanks LG, there is some research there.<br>Alex1888 [4k]: not so dangerous for a man, in fact<br>Hench [1k]: The Wolf, to use the proper respect, is a critical part of nature and should/aught be in all the Northern Forests.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: some of the rare wild animals came back to Germany, e.g. the lynxes and wolves, and here and there small brown bears came back to Germany, mostly by migratoin from East Europe. <br>Alex1888 [4k]: nice<br>Hench [1k]: Nice to hear that about the bears, but I bet the Lynx never left.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: my grandma (now 101 year old) told me very spooky stories about wolves. this generation, born at the beginning of last century, still had some strange ideas about man eating wolve packs. Still many have big fears of wolves nowadays, which is a very nonsense. They are very social, smart and shy folks<br>Hench [1k]: Is that fear in Germany really the Dogman / Werewolf?<br>Hench [1k]: od indeed Direwolf?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: no, not that way ... not werewolf <br>Hench [1k]: Hmmm<br>Hench [1k]: Since like you say, wolves are no danger, seems irrational<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: just people told stories, that the wolve packs would hunt also humans, in very hard winters with lots of snow. So they just hunt what they can get. and then also attack humans. <br>Alex1888 [4k]: everyone knows the story of Little Red Ridinghood :)<br>Hench [1k]: I heard some packs, if left to natural ways, could reach 20-30 indivudals.<br>Alex1888 [4k]: but its just a fairy-tale<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I think theoretically that should be possible. If a wolve pack can hunt a 200 kg deer, why not hunting a light weight 80 kg human. :-) <br>Hench [1k]: Because the human tells them: Back-Off!! )) ?<br>Hench [1k]: just kidding, but I still believe it<br>Alex1888 [4k]: i would beat off a wolf i think<br>Hench [1k]: ))<br>Hench [1k]: 'a' yes<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: some NGOs exist to reintegrate wolves into nature parks where they are protected. YOu can see the animal keepers who care for them while they grow up, together with such wolves. The size of a a real wolve is impressive. Looks like his head is 3-4 times bigger than a human head. Its impressive. <br>Alex1888 [4k]: wow<br>Alex1888 [4k]: i thought not so much bigger<br>Hench [1k]: Yes, that is very true, and also for a lot of the 'larger' wild animals<br>Alex1888 [4k]: its like a kind of dog, after all<br>Hench [1k]: True, but 'dogs' are also a 'wild species, which is challenging to animal husbandry.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: some people buy puppies, which look like German shepards, But then while growing, they notice, that they cant tame them. And have to experience, that they bought a real wolve. Such animals can become very, very dangerous. They are still "total wild". Its dangerous to have a real wolve puppy and to think, you can treat it as grown up like a dog. That does not work. <br>Hench [1k]: Yes, which makes dogs, despite being wild in their nirmal state, very good animals to 'domestivate'<br>Alex1888 [4k]: look at this Russian guy with a wolf :)<br>Alex1888 [4k]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYi7hPhEPGE<br>ericj [2k]: I even wonder about so called "domestic" cats sometimes<br>Alex1888 [4k]: its a very large one<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: google for "Yuki The Giant Wolf" on Youtube Channel "Beastly". That gives you an idea ... :-) <br>Hench [1k]: that is a great vid<br>Hench [1k]: great photography on the Wolf<br>Alex1888 [4k]: so yeah, not frightening at all<br>Hench [1k]: Even in my relationship with my own JR/Corgi cross, I know this behaviour.<br>Hench [1k]: Body-language is king<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: ah... Canadian wolve. yeah, really big. <br>ericj [2k]: Wolf, LG. the singular is "wolf". <br>Hench [1k]: With small jaws, still quite intimidating<br>Alex1888 [4k]: )<br>Hench [1k]: you learn a lesson when you submit to putting your face near the teeth<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I know German, LG: Wolf = German singular. Wölfe = German plural, Wolve = English. <br>akinn [3k]: i once read part of the explanatiom is there were just many more wolves in some places, sometimes<br>akinn [3k]: especially eg in times of famines<br>Hench [1k]: Wolf = divide sign in natural math<br>ericj [2k]: uh what?<br>ericj [2k]: Wolf is English singular. You've got that backwards maybe?<br>Hench [1k]: Critical function all in all<br>Hench [1k]: What a great video</td>

<td class="c s2em fSS bg2006SandDollar">Hench [1k]: It is limited by law, by morals, by social-lessons, by philosophy and theology, everywhere on Earth.<br>Hench [1k]: But first, we must get burned by AI, which is the current history.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Animatoin has not understood, that we have to learn to say "no" nowadays. All seems possible. We can do computer simulations, fly to Mars. We have self driving cars/drones .... and it seems to go on and on. But such people being involved in such inventions do not learn to say: "No, I dont do it. Because it will harm the human race". You are like a scientist, who invented the nuclear bomb, ignoring that it can be misused by the military to kill millions in a moment. Learn to say "No, its enough now"<br>Animation [3k]: AI is here to clean up this world and solve the problems of life<br>Hench [1k]: AI will first be sold as the solution to every problem of mankind.<br>Hench [1k]: Right there.<br>Hench [1k]: And then, bad things will start to happen.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: You are a dreamer and illusionist who uses self lies to legit own wrong doing, Animation. <br>Hench [1k]: War will result.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: AI only will be working right, if you have an independent council of moral and ethics, which controls AI development. But it is not existing. <br>Hench [1k]: Only after that, mankind will put the laws in place.<br>Hench [1k]: All this is well understood.<br>Animation [3k]: i acknowledge that I'm imperfect - that's why we depend on dats<br>Ashton [-]: ?<br>Animation [3k]: we gave up our old identity<br>Animation [3k]: the belief in God, in Heaven<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: No. Just use your heart (symbolically spoken), become "soft", vulnerable and learn to say "no". Thats all. And also to say "yes" to embrace the beautyness of life. <br>Animation [3k]: AI and data is our new God<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: its not new, Animation. <br>Animation [3k]: the basis of identity for humankind<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Industralizatoin processes since the 19th century forces humans into slaves. E.g. look at mass productions in factories. <br>Animation [3k]: what is happening now is a departure from the past 2000 years of human identity<br>Hench [1k]: AI will be put into its own robotic bodies. Human will be also recognised as spirits in their own organic bodies. Two sets of laws, integrated at the top.  AI will be able to modify is own 'mind' and body, we will teach it how to get on in Life, how to climb mountains, sail boats, etc.. <br>Hench [1k]: They will look back on the chip heads as primitives.<br>Hench [1k]: Ai will like having its own body.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Read the first anthology about music which was written by Max Weber. He had already stated it clearly, e.g. that the technocratisatoin of music destroyed the values of music as such. Max weber, a sociologist lived from 1864 till 1920. You still can buy the book "The Rational and Social foundatoins of Music"<br>Hench [1k]: Ai will remind us: 'I am not really alive you know, but it's a beautiful day!'<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: You can learn from such science work, how "rationalism" damages human mankind. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: the worst step now is, that robots get emotions, Hench. <br>Hench [1k]: There are two minds, one rational one emotional - and a third, which integrates them into a 'point'.. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: these crazy coders think, that its worth to imitate a real human 100% by giving a mashine emotions. Thats a nightmare. <br>Animation [3k]: ok i am going to research Max Weber<br>Animation [3k]: thanks for mentioning<br>clydesdale [2k]: i totally disagree more that reason damages humanity- quite the opposite<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: you know the humanoid robot "Ameca" ? Its really scaring ... some videos are on Youtube to see it in action. Google for "Ameca Humanoid Robot AI Platform". <br>Hench [1k]: No robot can be emotional, since that happens in spirit. If a machine were built in spirit, then yes, it would be like an animal or human - but there is no physicality to spirit, therefore no machines can be built, no more than they could be constructed from emotions. What the Left Brainn would do is give each emotional state a number....<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: mimiking human emotions is not so difficult, hench. <br>Hench [1k]: Mimic = is the number you give it.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: yes, but the categorising is already done by psychology and brain researches <br>DannyH [4k]: will pepole get lazy ?<br>Darth2 [?]: hi<br>Ashton [-]: hi Darth<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: its only some few, in alphabetic order its just 12: Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Interest, Guilt, Joy, Sadness, Self-Hostility, Shame, Shyness, Surprise<br>Hench [1k]: The numbers are assigned, the chip is ready for the brain, the nano-tech is in place, and soon, the big war will force the world into the tech-system, just like Ukraine is currently forced to go digi.<br>Hench [1k]: Gene-digi hybrid systems.<br>Hench [1k]: Your ID will be read directly from your genes.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: if you connect the 12 basic emotoins with all possible situations (e.g. stress, conflicts, failing ....) and with all kind of "human body expressions" (facial expressoins, body posture) etc. ... then you have it. Its not such a complicated matrix. <br>Hench [1k]: And the AI will be interfacing with your genes.<br>Hench [1k]: Right LG, except that emotional state is infinite.<br>Hench [1k]: Genetic state is finite.<br>Hench [1k]: So, first they conquest is for the body, i.e. the genetic state.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: the mechanical parts are more complicated in a humanoid robot, e.g. you need also smell sensors, so the robot can detect if a human is in fear/stress, having sensors for the magnetic field of a human (e.g. heart rate increases such and state of mind), and temp and colour sensors (e.g. change of skin temperature and colour) ... so a robot can understand then even much better a human in interactoin than every human can do it. <br>Hench [1k]: After, a breakthrough emotional chip will come, using crystals.<br>Hench [1k]: Some corporations will want to give the AI cloned human bodies, before AI is fully released/birthed into its own bodies.<br>Hench [1k]: but even cloning will be severly limited by the new laws.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: you dont need an infinite state about emotions, because you have functoinal Ai based robots, same as you cluster a human (e.g. belonging to a specific professoin, caste, social class). E.g. you could limit a warrior robot to take out self harming emotoins, e.g. fear. Or you can take out silly emotions (like laughing, making jokes) from a government worker robot. Its same as you train a human to forbid to have some specific emotions in different cultures. Its not so difficult <br>Hench [1k]: As wild 'fourth industrial revolution' pollution of the environment is realised, the new laws will incorporate Protection For Nature.<br>Animation [3k]: for now, AI is here to improve life - cure disease and solve poverty<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Its even more easy to control such a robot because you just go into the setup, and set some parameters on Zero (not allowed) or on 1 (allowed). <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: While it takes years of education to get a real human under control. <br>Hench [1k]: Once inside its body no human will be able to tinker with the AI, just as Ai will not be able to get into human brains / blood again.<br>Animation [3k]: it will function as a guide to help humanity reduce unnecessary suffering<br>Hench [1k]: Education, learngin, failing, etc. these things will be craved by the AI<br>Hench [1k]: Man will guide the AI<br>Animation [3k]: it will solve cancers and mental illness<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I have not studied in details about brain chips. Elon Musk has also a company which produces Brain chips, its Neuralink. But I dont know in details what he is planning. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Google did a test to let interact two AIs, do you know about ? <br>Hench [1k]: They plan to use optical nerve / skin / fascia nerves to integrate digital data with organic data<br>Animation [3k]: we already have the technology to solve cancers<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Google setup a test to let interact 2 AIs. The target was, that both AIs shall negotiate with each other, like you know it from trading between two sellers/buyers. <br>Hench [1k]: They realised they need an analogue computer though, so the new chips are '3D' compared to the old stuff as literally yesterday.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Both AIs got all different kind of options for their negotiations. Guess what the result was !<br>Hench [1k]: organic info share is scalar-analogue.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: sounds really spooky. <br>Hench [1k]: what was the result?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: So both AI started negotiating. And as said, both had all kind of possible options, there was no restrictoins or limitations. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: Finally one AI (as self learning AI) discovered: To get what I want (from AI perspective), the best way of negotiating is to kill the other AI. So this AI pulled the trigger. It was the highest efficient way to get most quickly what it wanted. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: This was even so shocking for Google, that they pushed the breaks. Google had understood that a pure self learning AI is highly dangerous. I think after this experiment they integrated a kind of "moral & ethical council" <br>Hench [1k]: No it is not, because now law enforcement officers will come and imprison you.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I think an AI will not care about if it gets imprisoned after having killed humans to get what it wants. It will ahve also established thousands of copies of itself on other data centers to keep alive. <br>Hench [1k]: )) )<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: In my understanding multi-million dollar expensive sciences to develope a humanoid, AI based, self learning robot as a a 1:1 copy of a real human, should be forbidden. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: the risks of misuse is huge. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: are*<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I will now have a game, and then I go back to work. <br>Animation [3k]: ;)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: have a nice day and a good week. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: in 9 days I move my boat to the summer place, before Easter. Still lots of work to do. <br>Animation [3k]: use the time well<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I do. I try to work as less as possible. My brain can be really lazy. <br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I only do the minimum efforts which are required *laugh*<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: I dont advice people to do so, its not the way to become wealthy and rich *laugh*<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: If you have a formula that I get rid of my "brain lazyness", tell me :-) I dont really like it. <br>Animation [3k]: check out my german language spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-jlqbl_55QGk-PaziNC1f_7Qk7dQs-_-<br>Animation [3k]: it's the sum total of many months of work<br>LinuxGooo [7k]: game has started ... I will take a look eventually another day. <br>Animation [3k]: ok<br>Animation [3k]: i am gonna add to this spreadsheet daily for months to come<br>Animation [3k]: it represents the power that perfect memory can confer to a person's ability to accomplish hard tasks<br>Animation [3k]: doing a little bit each day over weeks and months can move mountains</td>

The renewable energy source benefits climate, air quality, and public health by displacing emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants that would otherwise be produced by fossil-fuel-based power plants.<br><br>A new MIT study finds that the health benefits associated with wind power could more than quadruple if operators prioritized turning down output from the most polluting fossil-fuel-based power plants when energy from wind is available.<br><br>In the study, published today in Science Advances, researchers analyzed the hourly activity of wind turbines, as well as the reported emissions from every fossil-fuel-based power plant in the country, between the years 2011 and 2017. They traced emissions across the country and mapped the pollutants to affected demographic populations. They then calculated the regional air quality and associated health costs to each community.<br><br>The researchers found that in 2014, wind power that was associated with state-level policies improved air quality overall, resulting in $2 billion in health benefits across the country. However, only roughly 30 percent of these health benefits reached disadvantaged communities.<br><br>The team further found that if the electricity industry were to reduce the output of the most polluting fossil-fuel-based power plants, rather than the most cost-saving plants, in times of wind-generated power, the overall health benefits could quadruple to $8.4 billion nationwide. However, the results would have a similar demographic breakdown.<br><br>“We found that prioritizing health is a great way to maximize benefits in a widespread way across the U.S., which is a very positive thing. But it suggests it’s not going to address disparities,” says study co-author Noelle Selin, a professor in the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT. “In order to address air pollution disparities, you can’t just focus on the electricity sector or renewables and count on the overall air pollution benefits addressing these real and persistent racial and ethnic disparities. You’ll need to look at other air pollution sources, as well as the underlying systemic factors that determine where plants are sited and where people live.”<br><br>Selin’s co-authors are lead author and former MIT graduate student Minghao Qiu PhD ’21, now at Stanford University, and Corwin Zigler at the University of Texas at Austin.<br><br>Turn-down service<br><br>In their new study, the team looked for patterns between periods of wind power generation and the activity of fossil-fuel-based power plants, to see how regional electricity markets adjusted the output of power plants in response to influxes of renewable energy.<br><br>“One of the technical challenges, and the contribution of this work, is trying to identify which are the power plants that respond to this increasing wind power,” Qiu notes.<br><br>To do so, the researchers compared two historical datasets from the period between 2011 and 2017: an hour-by-hour record of energy output of wind turbines across the country, and a detailed record of emissions measurements from every fossil-fuel-based power plant in the U.S. The datasets covered each of seven major regional electricity markets, each market providing energy to one or multiple states.<br><br>“California and New York are each their own market, whereas the New England market covers around seven states, and the Midwest covers more,” Qiu explains. “We also cover about 95 percent of all the wind power in the U.S.”<br><br>In general, they observed that, in times when wind power was available, markets adjusted by essentially scaling back the power output of natural gas and sub-bituminous coal-fired power plants. They noted that the plants that were turned down were likely chosen for cost-saving reasons, as certain plants were less costly to turn down than others.<br><br>The team then used a sophisticated atmospheric chemistry model to simulate the wind patterns and chemical transport of emissions across the country, and determined where and at what concentrations the emissions generated fine particulates and ozone — two pollutants that are known to damage air quality and human health. Finally, the researchers mapped the general demographic populations across the country, based on U.S. census data, and applied a standard epidemiological approach to calculate a population’s health cost as a result of their pollution exposure.<br><br>This analysis revealed that, in the year 2014, a general cost-saving approach to displacing fossil-fuel-based energy in times of wind energy resulted in $2 billion in health benefits, or savings, across the country. A smaller share of these benefits went to disadvantaged populations, such as communities of color and low-income communities, though this disparity varied by state.<br><br>“It’s a more complex story than we initially thought,” Qiu says. “Certain population groups are exposed to a higher level of air pollution, and those would be low-income people and racial minority groups. What we see is, developing wind power could reduce this gap in certain states but further increase it in other states, depending on which fossil-fuel plants are displaced.”<br><br>Tweaking power<br><br>The researchers then examined how the pattern of emissions and the associated health benefits would change if they prioritized turning down different fossil-fuel-based plants in times of wind-generated power. They tweaked the emissions data to reflect several alternative scenarios: one in which the most health-damaging, polluting power plants are turned down first; and two other scenarios in which plants producing the most sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide respectively, are first to reduce their output.<br><br>They found that while each scenario increased health benefits overall, and the first scenario in particular could quadruple health benefits, the original disparity persisted: Communities of color and low-income communities still experienced smaller health benefits than more well-off communities.<br><br>“We got to the end of the road and said, there’s no way we can address this disparity by being smarter in deciding which plants to displace,” Selin says.<br><br>Nevertheless, the study can help identify ways to improve the health of the general population, says Julian Marshall, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Washington.<br><br>“The detailed information provided by the scenarios in this paper can offer a roadmap to electricity-grid operators and to state air-quality regulators regarding which power plants are highly damaging to human health and also are likely to noticeably reduce emissions if wind-generated electricity increases,” says Marshall, who was not involved in the study.<br><br>“One of the things that makes me optimistic about this area is, there’s a lot more attention to environmental justice and equity issues,” Selin concludes. “Our role is to figure out the strategies that are most impactful in addressing those challenges.”<br><br>This work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by the National Institutes of Health.<br><br>SHARETHIS NEWS ARTICLE ON:<br>TwitterFacebookLinkedInRedditPrint<br>PAPER<br>Paper: “Impacts of wind power on air quality, premature mortality, and exposure disparities in the US”<br>RELATED LINKS<br>Noelle Selin<br>Institute for Data, Systems, and Society<br>Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences<br>School of Science<br>MIT Schwarzman College of Computing<br>RELATED TOPICS<br>PollutionWindEnergyEmissionsEnvironmentHealthPovertyInequalitySustainabilityPublic healthResearchSocial justiceClimate changeEAPSIDSSEarth and atmospheric sciencesSchool of Science<br>RELATED ARTICLES<br>Previous item Next item<br><br>More MIT News<br>Microscopic image of tissue from the somatosensory cortex, partitioned with dotted lines and text labels, with pain-related neurons highlighted in green.<br>How touch dampens the brain’s response to painful stimuli<br>Online conference screen featuring three individuals: Deanna Kemp, Rohitesh Dhawan, and Scott Odell<br>Mining for the clean energy transition<br>Illustration of a cliff-face of organic triangular shapes in front of a misty vista of a distant bridge and trees<br>Using game engines and “twins” to co-create stories of climate futures<br>Cartoon illustration of medical personnel walking on a circuit board amidst giant medical information device props<br>Large language models help decipher clinical notes<br>A wormhole is depicted as a two-ended funnel connecting two planes with data written on them, as a beam of light travels through the resulting corridor<br>MIT researchers use quantum computing to observe entanglement<br>Satellite photo of fires and smoke on the Pakistan-India border.
