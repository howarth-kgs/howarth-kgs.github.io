If there had been we would have known. This link you posted is more than likely a TV-Rip. Basically the same thing I uploaded. Maybe just maybe a bit better. You know better VCR or Cassette. I wouldn't waste my money on that. Just so you know this show originally was distributed by MCA TV. Which was later on bought by Universal. Since this was originally an MCA product Universal did not have any rights over it. If they did. We would have probably seen a DVD release. And do you think Universal after a DVD release would allow my uploads to stay on YouTube? I am sure they would file a copyright claim on all my Bionic Six shows.<br><br>adelaine at 2016-01-26 04:39 CET:<br><br>Does no one notice the aspect is screwed?? It's squished vertical.

Kennedy remains for many as provocative as ever.<br><br>The controversy has spawned a virtual cottage industry of assassination books, more than 600 over the past three decades. Critical of the official explanation of a single assassin acting alone, the combined tomes offer a smorgasbord of conspiracy theories: Step right up and take your pick of everything from the FBI and the CIA to the KGB and the mob.<br><br>Now comes a self-published book from an unlikely team of assassination investigators--a Garden Grove sign shop owner and a Bellingham, Wash., real estate agent--that purports to fill in many of the missing pieces of the JFK assassination puzzle, new information that the authors maintain leads directly to Lyndon B. Johnson.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>“The Men on the Sixth Floor” (Sample Graphics; $15) by Glen Sample and Mark Collom chronicles their investigation of Loy Factor, a Chickasaw from Oklahoma, who claimed to have been with Lee Harvey Oswald in the Texas School Book Depository on that tragic November day.<br><br>In taped interviews conducted before his death in 1994 due to complications of diabetes, the 67-year-old Factor told Sample and Collom that it was he, Oswald and a man Factor knew only as Wallace who were positioned with rifles behind open windows overlooking Dealey Plaza.<br><br>A fourth person on the sixth floor--a young Latina named Ruth Ann--communicated with unknown individuals over a walkie-talkie. And, according to Factor, as the president’s limousine rounded onto Elm Street in front of the book depository building, the woman waved her hand downward as she counted: “One . . . two . . . three.”<br><br>On the down-stroke of three, according to Factor, the gunmen each fired a single shot, then fled downstairs--Ruth Ann and Factor to their car parked in the book depository lot; Oswald and Wallace in different directions.<br><br>Sample and Collom say they have identified the mystery man who hired Factor: Malcolm E. Wallace, a Lyndon Johnson associate who has been linked to two previous murders. One of the murders was that of a man thought to have been having an affair with Wallace’s estranged wife. The other is the 1961 death of a U.S. Department of Agriculture official who was investigating the legality of cotton allotments to LBJ’s millionaire Texan crony Billie Sol Estes, later convicted of fraud and tax evasion.<br><br>Wallace died in a single-car accident in Texas in 1971 at the age of 50.<br><br>“No one has ever before linked Wallace to the assassination,” said Sample, 47, in an interview at his home in Garden Grove. “We make the statement [in the book] that the road leads clearly and without obstruction to Lyndon Johnson.”<br><br>Is it possible? Have Sample and Collom shed light on what they refer to as “the most devastating assassination in history”?<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>*<br><br>Dave Perry, a Dallas insurance claims investigator who has been researching the Kennedy assassination for 19 years, views Loy Factor’s claim to have been on the sixth floor with Oswald the same as he views other assassination-related allegations: “with much skepticism.”<br><br>Perry, in fact, has reviewed all the available literature that has come out since the assassination and found a total of 61 people in the vicinity of Dealey Plaza who are said to have either shot the president or served as accomplices.<br><br>Thirty-four alone are listed as “shooters.”<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>They range from the so-called Umbrella Man on the northwest curb of Elm Street who is said to have shot a poison dart at the president to a drummer in Frank Sinatra’s band who is said to have fired a shot from the grassy knoll.<br><br>Sample, who was in a high school wood shop in Yreka, Calif., in 1963 when he heard that Kennedy had been shot, is a relative newcomer to the assassination research community. In fact, before he and Collom began their investigation into Loy Factor’s story in 1992, he says he had read only one book about the assassination.<br><br>Married 27 years and the father of two sons, Sample says he and his wife Dorothy are “just quiet, normal people that live in Garden Grove.”<br><br>The mere thought they he and Collom have interviewed a man that they are convinced was involved with the death of the president causes Sample to shake his head and laugh in disbelief.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>“We still joke about what a fluke to run into this story--a little sign painter from Garden Grove and a real estate agent from Bellingham,” said Sample. “If we’re the victims of a tremendous hoax, we’ve really been taken, but I don’t think so.”<br><br>For Sample, who did most of the writing, pursuing Factor’s story gradually took over his life. Working on the book “in bits and pieces” over three years, he and Collom would take time off from work to make research trips to Oklahoma and Texas.<br><br>“It was a project that never left my mind, especially the last year and a half,” says Sample, who is now focusing on finding a national distributor for the book.<br><br>*<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>As chronicled in their book, the seed for “The Men on the Sixth Floor” was planted in 1971 when Collom, then 21, first met Loy Factor.<br><br>At the time, Collom was serving a 16-month sentence for a drug-related conviction in the state prison in McAlester, Okla., (a fact that Sample included in an early press release announcing their findings but is not mentioned in the book). Factor, who was imprisoned for the 1968 strangulation death of his wife, was paroled in 1977.<br><br>Confined together in a hospital isolation ward for many weeks, the authors say, Factor told Collom the story only his wife had known.<br><br>In 1961, Factor told Collom, he and his wife and children drove down to Bonham, Texas, for the funeral of Sam Rayburn, the legendary speaker of the House and Lyndon Johnson’s political mentor.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Factor and his family were standing among the throngs lining the street hoping to catch a glimpse of Kennedy, Johnson and other government dignitaries, when a stranger--Wallace--struck up a conversation.<br><br>Wallace’s interest was piqued when Factor mentioned his ability as a hunter and marksman. Before Wallace left, he asked for Factor’s address, saying that he might have some work for him in the future and would look him up.<br><br>A year later, Wallace showed up at Factor’s modest home in rural Fillmore, Okla., and asked him to demonstrate his ability with a rifle. Factor, whom Sample and Collom describe as a simple and unsophisticated man, happily obliged.<br><br>Impressed, Wallace told Factor he was willing to pay for his shooting ability--to kill someone--and offered him $10,000: $2,000 that day and the remaining $8,000 to be paid when the job was finished.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Greed, the authors believe, caused Factor to accept the offer. And by the time he learned who his target would be, Factor felt he would be in danger if he backed out.<br><br>On Nov. 19, 1963, the woman identified as Ruth Ann arrived at Factor’s home and drove him to a small house in Dallas where he met Wallace.<br><br>Over the next two days, the trio reviewed plans, maps of Dallas and the presidential motorcade route. Occasionally, Factor said, they were joined by two other men: Lee Harvey Oswald and the man who would later kill Oswald, Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby.<br><br>*<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Sample first heard about Factor’s story in 1975--when he and his old high school buddy Collom were reunited.<br><br>Over the years, the two men made several unsuccessful attempts to track down Factors’ phone number in Oklahoma, but didn’t aggressively pursue finding him.<br><br>Then, in early 1992, Collom read a Life magazine article about Oliver Stone’s “JFK” movie that mentioned assassination researcher Larry N. Howard, director of the JFK Assassination Information Center in Dallas.<br><br>Collom phoned Howard. Intrigued, Howard promised to look into Loy Factor and invited Sample and Collom to Dallas so he could videotape an interview with them for his archives.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>With research help from Howard, Sample and Collom tracked down Factor, by then in ill health and living in a mobile home on a farm in Tonkawa, Okla. During the first of two interviews, Sample says, Factor confirmed what he had told Collom 21 years earlier and gave permission for them to tell his story.<br><br>Although Factor consistently denied pulling the trigger--he insisted he merely went through the motions of firing at Kennedy--Sample maintains that Factor did shoot at Kennedy and was trying to distance himself from the crime.<br><br>It is the details of Factor’s story, Sample says, that make it believable.<br><br>One of the most significant details, the authors say, is Factor’s offhanded remark that upon arriving on the sixth floor with Ruth Ann, he saw Oswald and Wallace sitting next to a table saw adjusting their rifle scopes.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>What, Sample and Collom wondered, was a table saw doing in a book warehouse?<br><br>*<br><br>Howard told them that floor construction was underway on the sixth floor at the time of the assassination. And a book depository employee who had worked with Oswald later told the authors that he recalled seeing a table saw and that it may have been near the windows by the east end of the building--the corner that Oswald shot from.<br><br>Sample says that no one has ever reported that a table saw was on the sixth floor at the time of the assassination.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Howard also recalled hearing about a “Mac” Wallace from alleged LBJ mistress Madeleine Brown, who claims to have heard Johnson make a veiled threat against Kennedy the night before the assassination.<br><br>Brown told the authors that Wallace had been associated with Johnson and that she suspected Wallace to have been involved in Kennedy’s assassination. A good portion of the book is spent on Wallace and his ties to Johnson.<br><br>Sample and Collom learned of Estes’ 1984 grand jury testimony saying Wallace was the triggerman in the 1961 death of U.S. Department of Agriculture official Henry Harvey Marshall. The death had been ruled a suicide--despite the fact that Marshall’s body was found with a .22 caliber bolt action rifle and he had five bullet holes in his side.<br><br>Protected from prosecution by a grant of immunity, Estes told grand jurors that he, Wallace, and Johnson were involved in planning the murder of Marshall.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>And, the authors learned, that despite being a convicted felon, Wallace, with Johnson’s intervention, had been able to gain security clearances working for firms that contracted with the government.<br><br>*<br><br>Perry finds much to dispute in “The Men on the Sixth Floor.” He says Sample and Collom’s reliance on statements by the woman who says she was LBJ’s mistress is one of the many problems with the book.<br><br>Perry says Brown has never provided sufficient evidence to prove that she was Johnson’s mistress. He also questions Brown’s claim that LBJ made a threat against the Kennedys at a party the night before the assassination. No one, Perry says, has ever substantiated that such a party ever occurred.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>*<br><br>“To be kind to [Sample and Collom], they have not gone to the right people to research their stories and most of the book is based on hearsay evidence,” says Perry.<br><br>“By far the most troubling problem is the propensity of the authors to reach a conclusion first and then look for evidence that supports that preconceived finale. Not only are ‘facts’ twisted, but even common sense is swept aside to make way for the claim that Loy Factor was involved.”<br><br>Having spent two decades researching the JFK assassination--a fair amount of it checking out other peoples’ theories--Perry says he’s found that inexperienced researchers “often get swept up in it and they get very excited because they think they’ve found something new.”<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Sample concedes that much of what he and Collom present in “The Men on the Sixth Floor” would never hold up in court, but he stands by Loy Factor’s story.<br><br>As one longtime assassination researcher says of the multitude of JFK assassination theories: “It’s like religion. You either believe it or you don’t.”<br><br>“The Men on the Sixth Floor” is available at the Green Door Mystery Bookstore in San Juan Capistrano, Coffee, Tea & Mystery in Westminster and by mail order: (800) 368-8724.<br><br>SUBSCRIBERS ARE READING<br><br>CALIFORNIA<br><br>California doing much better with Delta variant than Florida, Texas.

But Sara's world changed for the icky when she discovered that Ira had been shielding her from the truth: that he was a campy sex writer who’d sold millions of books in multiple languages. For decades, these books remained an unspoken family secret, until Ira developed early onset Alzheimer's disease…and announced he'd be reviving his writing career. With Sara's help. In her memoir, Sara shares the profound experience of discovering new facets of her father --- once as a child, and again as an adult.<br><br>￼<br><br>Biography<br><br>Bibliography<br><br>Find an Author<br><br>VIEW ALL BY AUTHOR »<br><br>bookreporter.com on Facebook<br><br>bookreporter.com on Twitter<br><br>Subscribe to our feeds<br><br>Shop with TBRN on IndieBound<br><br>Shop with TBRN on Amazon<br><br>Shop with TBRN on Barnes & Noble<br><br>Copyright © 2021 The Book Report, Inc.

Many Angels in Heaven will have a willing helper, following them around to see what can be done, how can he help, a way to share the burden.

Now that strategy is playing out on a national scale, with the Taliban taking over provinces in ways that cut off major cities from each other, restrict revenue and goods into the capital, and increasingly surround and isolate Kabul. The Taliban now control most of Afghanistan’s border crossings, which denies revenue for the government and enables the Taliban to tax trade to fund their fighting. A map of Taliban controlled districts illustrates how much Kabul is surrounded to the north, south and west. The only safe route out is east to Jalalabad and Pakistan. One can assume the Taliban will focus on that next. An encirclement strategy aims to sap the government’s strength over time. The idea is that with enough pressure and deprivation, the government will sue the Taliban for peace and give the Taliban most of what they want in the process. This will be a victory for the Taliban but could result in some balance of power that different ethnic and political factions can accept.<br><br>The Tipping Point: A quicker scenario leading to a Taliban takeover involves the Taliban reaching a psychological tipping point whereby their ultimate victory appears to be inevitable to a critical mass of political leaders and power brokers who then switch sides or surrender rapidly to avoid costly fighting or persecution under a new political order. In many cases, this has already occurred — with reports of posts being abandoned or surrendered outnumbering cases of pitched battles. Historically, this is how power has often changed hands in Afghanistan. In 1996, what seemed like a steady but slow Taliban advance quickly became a rout when Kabul’s defenses collapsed and the Taliban were able to advance into the city with barely a days’ notice. This scenario seems more and more likely in light of the Taliban’s recent rapid advances. It would provide the Taliban with maximal gains and would likely lead to a return of their self-declared Emirate — or something close to it. <br><br>Bouncing off rock bottom: A more hopeful scenario is that the Afghan government and an anti-Taliban coalition of political leaders will be galvanized by the existential threat the group’s advances pose to the state and their way of life and will unite in a more coordinated and spirited opposition. President Biden seemed to count on this scenario when he noted on Tuesday that the United States was continuing to provide Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) with air support and other resources, but said, “They’ve got to want to fight.” President Ghani met with leaders in Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday in an attempt to pool resources and increase political motivation for northern constituencies to fight back against Taliban gains. The concern is that this effort at political unity may be too little, too late. If the ANDSF can hold back the Taliban from capturing the biggest cities and all transport routes, it will provide time for Afghan forces to adjust to the new reality of fighting without U.S. and NATO enablers and take the fight back to the Taliban. This would still leave a grinding war of attrition, but one that is more likely to produce the kind of battlefield stalemate that makes productive peace negotiations more likely.<br><br>Unfortunately, all of these scenarios have enormous human costs for Afghans and are unlikely to produce stability any time soon. If the Afghan government holds out, it will remain weak and fragile and Taliban momentum will need to be reversed or stopped for a while before it is likely to negotiate any serious compromise political settlement.  <br><br>If the Taliban are able to take control more rapidly, it will face even more daunting governance challenges: the Taliban alienate some ethnic groups, the vast majority of Afghan citizens do not want to live under their rule, they are unlikely to attract significant donor aid given recent atrocities and repressive policies, and they have no apparent plan or experience running a modern state. Even if it takes some time for routed anti-Taliban forces to regroup, a counter-revolution seems inevitable unless a balanced and inclusive political settlement can be reached. <br><br>Where to Go From Here?<br><br>Slowing the Taliban’s momentum is no easy task — but no one in the region wants to see a Taliban takeover or benefits from the aftermath of the fall of Kabul. As the Taliban advances, Washington should do the following:<br><br>Extend its “over-the-horizon” support for the ANDSF. The United States has already conducted limited air strikes to blunt Taliban offensives against major cities but is still deciding whether to continue after August 31 when President Biden declared all troops would be out of the country. Maintaining strikes after that date would not only provide critical support but also boost morale. And once the Taliban seek to hold checkpoints and occupy their own bases it should be easier to target them and help the Afghan forces regain territory, creating a change in momentum. The surprise announcement on Thursday that 3,000 U.S. troops are being sent to secure the Kabul airport for evacuations could also bolster Afghan military morale.<br><br>Describe clear consequences for Taliban human rights atrocities. The U.S. Embassy tweeted last week that it was tracking reports of war crimes and other atrocities by the Taliban but Washington has not laid out a specific plan to deter atrocities. Washington should call on the U.N. Human Rights Commission to conduct a formal fact-finding mission into alleged atrocities and make it clear that sanctions on Taliban leaders will increase if war crimes or other atrocities occur under their leadership. The United States should also provide greater funding for human rights monitoring and investigation by Afghan organizations on the ground.<br><br>Call for a U.N. Security Council resolution that authorizes U.N. facilitation of a peace process. As the U.N. Afghanistan mission’s Special Representative of the Secretary-General Deborah Lyons argued at a special session of the U.N. Security council last week, the situation in Afghanistan has become a threat to regional stability and international security that requires greater U.N. attention. All five permanent members of the Security Council agree that a Taliban takeover by force is illegitimate and the Afghan parties must negotiate a political settlement to avoid a broader regional crisis. This should be reinforced with the full weight of the Security Council and a U.N. facilitator should be appointed to give more urgency to intra-Afghan talks.<br><br>Rally regional support for intra-Afghan talks. Outside of Afghans themselves, Afghanistan’s neighbors have the most at stake from the Taliban’s potential violent takeover, which would disrupt regional trade, lead to a massive exodus of refugees and could lead to destabilizing proxy wars. At conferences this year in Moscow and Doha, Russia, China and Pakistan all affirmed that the future of Afghanistan should be decided through dialogue and political negotiations. Now more than ever, these regional players must exert whatever leverage they have to bring the Afghan parties to the table and the United States should provide incentives for them to do so.<br><br>Deny the Taliban legitimacy if they take power by force. The Taliban have relished the international attention their negotiators have received by global diplomats trying to establish an inclusive political settlement. But so far they have not put forward any plan for compromise while their forces march on Kabul. The international community should deny the Taliban travel privileges from Doha as long as fighting supersedes intra-Afghan talks. The United States and its allies should also make clear to the Taliban that if they do take Kabul by force, the movement will not be recognized as a legitimate government and it will lose all but humanitarian assistance. <br><br>ISSUE AREAS<br><br>￼Conflict Analysis & Prevention<br><br>COUNTRIES<br><br>￼Afghanistan<br><br>￼<br><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br>Scott Worden<br><br>Director, Afghanistan and Central Asia Programs<br><br>View Profile<br><br>STAY INFORMED<br><br>USIP has a variety of newsletters and announcements with the latest analysis, publications and events.<br><br>Sign up!<br><br>RELATED PUBLICATIONS<br><br>￼<br><br>Afghanistan-Pakistan Ties and Future Stability in Afghanistan<br><br>Thursday, August 12, 2021<br><br>By: Elizabeth Threlkeld; Grace Easterly<br><br>The situation in Afghanistan—and with it the Afghanistan-Pakistan relationship—is likely to worsen in the short term.

For the ghost story by Algernon Blackwood, see The Empty House (Blackwood).￼<br><br>First page of an adaptation of "The Adventure of the Empty House" which appears in the first (and only) issue of DC Comics' Sherlock Holmes from October 1975.<br><br>"The Adventure of the Empty House" is a Sherlock Holmes short story by the British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was first published in 1903. It appears as the first story in the 1905 anthology The Return of Sherlock Holmes. It is notable for being the story in which Sherlock Holmes, who had been killed off in the 1893 short story "The Final Problem", is revealed to be still alive and ready to have many more adventures.[1]<br><br>The plot is set in motion when Dr. John Watson, the story's narrator, reads of the unexplained murder of the Honorable Ronald Adair at his home in Park Lane and attempts to solve the mystery. Out of curiosity, Watson goes to Park Lane, where he bumps into an old man whom he later finds out is Holmes in disguise. Holmes explains to his friend how and why he faked his death. He also informs him that his life is still in danger.<br><br>There have been numerous adaptations of "The Adventure of the Empty House" to other media, often in combination with elements taken from other stories about Holmes and Watson.<br><br>"The Adventure of the Empty House" is included in a list of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's twelve favorite Sherlock Holmes compiled for the magazine The Strand in 1927[2] and a list of the ten best Sherlock Holmes short stories which were voted for by the readers of The Baker Street Journal in 1959.[3]<br><br>Contents<br><br>1 Plot<br><br>2 Adaptations<br><br>3 See also<br><br>4 Footnotes<br><br>5 External links<br><br>Plot<br><br>￼<br><br>Watson does not know that he has bumped into Holmes in disguise. 1903 illustration by Sidney Paget.<br><br>The story takes place in the spring of 1894. The Honorable Ronald Adair, a young man with no known enemies, has been found dead in the bedroom of the Park Lane home which he shared with his mother and sister. He was killed by a single shot to the head, the bullet being one from a revolver. Nothing was stolen from Ronald Adair's bedroom, coins and banknotes were found stacked in neat piles on a table next to a list of names. The bedroom door was locked from the inside and there was no sign of anyone having entered or left through the window. Ronald Adair is known to have played cards for money earlier that day with Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy and Colonel Moran. He lost a small amount of money which he could easily afford. Ronald Adair's partnership at cards with Colonel Moran had proved profitable for the young man, the two men had won four hundred and twenty-five pounds a few days earlier.<br><br>In common with most other people in London, Dr. John Watson is fascinated by the Adair murder case. Since the death of his detective friend Sherlock Holmes three years earlier, Dr. Watson has tried to use his late friend's methods to solve mysteries. In the evening, he goes to Park Lane. He hears a police detective speaking about the Adair murder but thinks that what the man is saying is nonsense. Watson bumps into an old man whom he takes for a bookseller, knocking some books out of his arms. The old man scowls at Watson as he hands his books back to him. Watson is surprised when the old man comes to his house later. He is even more surprised when the old bookseller reveals himself to be Sherlock Holmes in disguise.<br><br>￼<br><br>Holmes becomes aware that a member of Moriarty's gang is trying to kill him. 1903 illustration by Frederic Dorr Steele.<br><br>Holmes tells his friend that, through his knowledge of Japanese wrestling, he was able to throw Professor Moriarty over the Reichenbach Falls while avoiding falling into the chasm himself. Holmes immediately concluded that, because there were still members of Moriarty's gang who wanted to kill him, it would be best to let the world believe he was dead. For that reason, so as not to leave footprints in the mud which would show he had walked away, Holmes climbed the cliffs, which Watson had incorrectly described as sheer in "The Final Problem". Holmes rested for a while on a ledge, until he noticed a colleague of Professor Moriarty throwing rocks at him. He managed to escape across the mountains and eventually arrived in Italy.<br><br>Following the trial of the members of Moriarty's criminal organization, two gang members, Sherlock Holmes' most dangerous enemies, escaped imprisonment. For that reason, Holmes kept the fact that he was still alive a secret from Dr. Watson. He feared that Watson's account of his death would be less credible if Watson knew that it was not true. However, he needed to reveal the truth to his brother Mycroft, who supplied him with money. Holmes spent the next two years traveling in Tibet (pretending to be a Norwegian explorer named Sigerson), the Middle East and Africa before doing scientific research in France. He followed news of crimes in Britain closely, certain that his enemies would do something that could lead to their arrest.<br><br>At night, Holmes and Watson take an unusual route to Baker Street. They enter an empty house opposite the apartment which they once shared. In the apartment window, Watson can see a silhouette which looks exactly like Sherlock Holmes. Holmes explains that it is a wax dummy which Mrs. Hudson, his landlady, moves slightly every fifteen minutes. Holmes watches the street for the enemy he is certain will try to attack him. Watson notices two men in a doorway but Holmes is not interested in them.<br><br>￼<br><br>Colonel Moran is detained by the police. 1903 illustration by Sidney Paget.<br><br>Shortly before midnight, a man in formal evening dress and carrying a walking stick enters the empty house. In the darkness, he does not notice Holmes or Watson. His walking stick is revealed to be a disguised air gun of sophisticated design. From the window of the empty house, the man shoots at what he believes is Sherlock Holmes, shattering the glass of the apartment window. At which point, Holmes jumps upon him. Holmes blows on a whistle, which summons Inspector Lestrade and two policemen, the two men whom Watson had seen in the doorway.<br><br>The man is revealed to be Colonel Moran, a man who had a not undistinguished career in the British Army in India and was well known as a tiger hunter. In spite of having lived a largely respectable life, Colonel Moran turned wicked in his later years. Being probably the best shot in London, Professor Moriarty hired him for jobs which were beyond the ability of common criminals. Moran was also the man who threw rocks at Holmes in Switzerland after the death of Professor Moriarty. Holmes tells Inspector Lestrade to arrest Colonel Moran not for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes but for the murder of Ronald Adair.<br><br>Back at his apartment in Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson shows Holmes the bullet which Colonel Moran fired. Although it was fired from an air gun, the bullet is of the kind usually fired from a revolver. Watson asks Holmes what Colonel Moran's motive was in murdering Ronald Adair. Holmes confesses that he does not really know. However, he believes that Colonel Moran cheated at cards, Adair found that out and planned to return his share of the money that he and Moran had won. Moran prevented that by murdering the young man to preserve his reputation. Holmes remarks that the truth will be revealed at Moran's trial.<br><br>Adaptations<br><br>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1921 stage play The Crown Diamond: An Evening with Sherlock Holmes is partially inspired by "The Adventure of the Empty House". In the play, Sherlock Holmes is the only person who knows for certain that Colonel Sebastian Moran has stolen a diamond. Colonel Moran plans to kill Holmes. He has an air gun made which is aimed at Holmes' apartment from a building across the street. Holmes has a dummy made to fool the Colonel. During the play's run, Doyle adapted it as the short story "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone". Colonel Sebastian Moran is replaced by a character called Count Negretto Sylvius in the short story adaptation.<br><br>￼<br><br>Basil Rathbone played Holmes in films including Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Woman in Green and Terror by Night.<br><br>Sherlock Holmes film adaptations which feature elements taken from "The Adventure of the Empty House" include The Empty House (UK, 1921), The Sleeping Cardinal (UK, 1931), Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon (USA, 1943),[4] The Woman in Green (USA, 1945),[5] Terror by Night (USA, 1946)[6]and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (UK/USA, 2011).<br><br>The story was adapted as the first episode of the BBC TV series Sherlock Holmes, starring Alan Wheatley, which first aired in the United Kingdom on October 20, 1951. It was adapted as the first episode of The Return of Sherlock Holmes, the second Granada TV Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett, which was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on July 9, 1986. "The Empty Hearse", the first episode of the third season of the BBC TV series Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, which first aired in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2014, is partially based on the story. The TV movie Hunt for the Tiger, part of the series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, which was shown on television in the Soviet Union in 1980, is a largely faithful adaptation of "The Adventure of the Empty House".<br><br>Adaptations of "The Adventure of the Empty House" and "The Final Problem" appear in issue #1 of DC Comics' Sherlock Holmes from October 1975. DC's Sherlock Holmes was intended to be an ongoing comic book series. However, due to poor sales, the series was cancelled after only one issue.<br><br>See also<br><br>Video of the 1943 film Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon<br><br>Video of the 1945 film The Woman in Green<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>↑ The 1902 novel The Hound of the Baskervilles was published between "The Final Problem" and "The Adventure of the Empty House".

Yellowish inclusions are pumice, dark stony fragments are lava, gray areas consist of other volcanic crystalline materials, and white spots are lime. Inset is a scanning electron microscope image of the special Al-tobermorite crystals that are key to the superior quality of Roman seawater concrete. (Click on image for best resolution.)<br><br>The chemical secrets of a concrete Roman breakwater that has spent the last 2,000 years submerged in the Mediterranean Sea have been uncovered by an international team of researchers led by Paulo Monteiro of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.<br><br>Analysis of samples provided by team member Marie Jackson pinpointed why the best Roman concrete was superior to most modern concrete in durability, why its manufacture was less environmentally damaging – and how these improvements could be adopted in the modern world.<br><br>“It’s not that modern concrete isn’t good – it’s so good we use 19 billion tons of it a year,” says Monteiro. “The problem is that manufacturing Portland cement accounts for seven percent of the carbon dioxide that industry puts into the air.”<br><br>Portland cement is the source of the “glue” that holds most modern concrete together. But making it releases carbon from burning fuel, needed to heat a mix of limestone and clays to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,642 degrees Fahrenheit) – and from the heated limestone (calcium carbonate) itself. Monteiro’s team found that the Romans, by contrast, used much less lime and made it from limestone baked at 900˚ C (1,652˚ F) or lower, requiring far less fuel than Portland cement.<br><br>Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is one powerful incentive for finding a better way to provide the concrete the world needs; another is the need for stronger, longer-lasting buildings, bridges, and other structures.<br><br>“In the middle 20th century, concrete structures were designed to last 50 years, and a lot of them are on borrowed time,” Monteiro says. “Now we design buildings to last 100 to 120 years.” Yet Roman harbor installations have survived 2,000 years of chemical attack and wave action underwater.<br><br>How the Romans did it<br><br>The Romans made concrete by mixing lime and volcanic rock. For underwater structures, lime and volcanic ash were mixed to form mortar, and this mortar and volcanic tuff were packed into wooden forms. The seawater instantly triggered a hot chemical reaction. The lime was hydrated – incorporating water molecules into its structure – and reacted with the ash to cement the whole mixture together.<br><br>￼<br><br>Pozzuoli Bay defines the northwestern region of the Bay of Naples. The concrete sample examined at the Advanced Light Source by Berkeley researchers, BAI.06.03, is from the harbor of Baiae, one of many ancient underwater sites in the region. Black lines indicate caldera rims, and red areas are volcanic craters. (Click on image for best resolution.)<br><br>Descriptions of volcanic ash have survived from ancient times. First Vitruvius, an engineer for the Emperor Augustus, and later Pliny the Elder recorded that the best maritime concrete was made with ash from volcanic regions of the Gulf of Naples (Pliny died in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius that buried Pompeii), especially from sites near today’s seaside town of Pozzuoli. Ash with similar mineral characteristics, called pozzolan, is found in many parts of the world.<br><br>Using beamlines 5.3.2.1, 5.3.2.2, 12.2.2 and 12.3.2 at Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source (ALS), along with other experimental facilities at UC Berkeley, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, and the BESSY synchrotron in Germany, Monteiro and his colleagues investigated maritime concrete from Pozzuoli Bay. They found that Roman concrete differs from the modern kind in several essential ways.<br><br>One is the kind of glue that binds the concrete’s components together. In concrete made with Portland cement this is a compound of calcium, silicates, and hydrates (C-S-H). Roman concrete produces a significantly different compound, with added aluminum and less silicon. The resulting calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) is an exceptionally stable binder.<br><br>At ALS beamlines 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2, x-ray spectroscopy showed that the specific way the aluminum substitutes for silicon in the C-A-S-H may be the key to the cohesion and stability of the seawater concrete.<br><br>Another striking contribution of the Monteiro team concerns the hydration products in concrete. In theory, C-S-H in concrete made with Portland cement resembles a combination of naturally occurring layered minerals, called tobermorite and jennite. Unfortunately these ideal crystalline structures are nowhere to be found in conventional modern concrete.<br><br>Tobermorite does occur in the mortar of ancient seawater concrete, however. High-pressure x-ray diffraction experiments at ALS beamline 12.2.2 measured its mechanical properties and, for the first time, clarified the role of aluminum in its crystal lattice. Al-tobermorite (Al for aluminum) has a greater stiffness than poorly crystalline C-A-S-H and provides a model for concrete strength and durability in the future.<br><br>Finally, microscopic studies at ALS beamline 12.3.2 identified the other minerals in the Roman samples. Integration of the results from the various beamlines revealed the minerals’ potential applications for high-performance concretes, including the encapsulation of hazardous wastes.<br><br>Lessons for the future<br><br>Environmentally friendly modern concretes already include volcanic ash or fly ash from coal-burning power plants as partial substitutes for Portland cement, with good results. These blended cements also produce C-A-S-H, but their long-term performance could not be determined until the Monteiro team analyzed Roman concrete.<br><br>Their analyses showed that the Roman recipe needed less than 10 percent lime by weight, made at two-thirds or less the temperature required by Portland cement. Lime reacting with aluminum-rich pozzolan ash and seawater formed highly stable C‑A-S-H and Al-tobermorite, insuring strength and longevity. Both the materials and the way the Romans used them hold lessons for the future.<br><br>“For us, pozzolan is important for its practical applications,” says Monteiro. “It could replace 40 percent of the world’s demand for Portland cement. And there are sources of pozzolan all over the world. Saudi Arabia doesn’t have any fly ash, but it has mountains of pozzolan.”<br><br>Stronger, longer-lasting modern concrete, made with less fuel and less release of carbon into the atmosphere, may be the legacy of a deeper understanding of how the Romans made their incomparable concrete.<br><br>This work was supported by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, the Loeb Classical Library Foundation at Harvard University, and DOE’s Office of Science, which also supports the Advanced Light Source.

EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.   <br><br>When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we’re on track to meet that target.<br><br>Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st.  The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart.  <br><br>Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown.  And in this context, speed is safety. <br><br>And thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one — no one U.S. forces or any forces have — have been lost.  Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with a increased risk of safety to our personnel.   <br><br>To me, those risks were unacceptable.  And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism.  That’s what they do.  And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supported — we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde.   <br><br>I want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August.  We remain — we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority — excuse me, the same authority under which we’ve been operating for some time.<br><br>As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States.  We achieved those objectives.  That’s why we went.<br><br>We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build.  And it’s the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country.   <br><br>Together, with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hu- — nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military — of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving.  Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades.<br><br>We provided our Afghan partners with all the tools — let me emphasize: all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military.  We provided advanced weaponry.  And we’re going to continue to provide funding and equipment.   And we’ll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force.<br><br>But most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve.<br><br>In our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure.  We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls.<br><br>I intend to maintain our diplomatic presedence [presence] in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport. <br><br>And we’re going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence. <br><br>I’ve asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution.   <br><br>To be clear — to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement.   We’ll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well.   <br><br>We’re going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark — excuse me — Fre– Frerichs — I want to pronounce the name correctly; I mis- — I misspoke — so that he can return to his family safely.<br><br>We’re also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators — since we’re no longer going to have military there after this; we’re not going to need them and they have no jobs — who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they — and they’ve been very vital — and so their families are not exposed to danger as well.<br><br>We’ve already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States.   <br><br>Since I was inaugurated on January 20th, we’ve already approved 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States.  Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that.  Half have gotten on aircraft and com — commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay — at least thus far.<br><br>We’re working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas.  And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed.<br><br>The operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they ch- — if they so choose.  And, starting this month, we’re going to begin to re- — re- — reloc- — we’re going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave.   <br><br>We have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts. <br><br>But our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.<br><br>When I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely.  I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates. <br><br>But for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history. <br><br>In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014.  In 2014, some argued, “One more year.”  So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties.  In 2015, the same.  And on and on.<br><br>Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that “just one more year” of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely.   <br><br>It’s up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country.<br><br>Others are more direct.  Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan — in Afghanistan indefinitely.  In doing so, they point to the fact that we — we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal.<br><br>But that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest mil- — is at its strongest militarily since 2001.<br><br>The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum.  And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the — with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past — of this year.  That’s what I inherited.  That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces. <br><br>If, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back — going back on that agreement made by the last administration — [that] the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future — the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces.<br><br>The status quo was not an option.  Staying would have meant<br>U.S. troops taking casualties; American men and women back in the middle of a civil war.  And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.<br><br>Once that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible.<br><br>So let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more — how many thousands more of America’s daughters and sons are you willing to risk?  How long would you have them stay?<br><br>Already we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago.  Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well?  Would you send your own son or daughter?<br><br>After 20 years — a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health — I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.<br><br>The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago.  We need to meet the threats where they are today.<br><br>Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan.  So, we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.<br><br>But make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan. <br><br>We are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed.<br><br>And we also need to focus on shoring up America’s core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine — determine our future. <br><br>We have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we’re better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat. <br><br>We need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergenc- — emerging technologies.<br><br>We need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change.<br><br>And we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years.<br><br>Finally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan. <br><br>I want to honor the significance of what they’ve accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet — and I’ve been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn’t been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out Bin Laden.<br><br>I want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given, and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war. <br><br>We’ll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country.<br><br>We’re ending America’s longest war, but we’ll always, always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it.<br><br>May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you.<br><br>Q    Mr. President — do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?<br><br>Q    Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  No, it is not.<br><br>Q    Why?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Because you — the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped — as well-equipped as any army in the world — and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban.  It is not inevitable.<br><br>Q    Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?  Do you trust the Taliban, sir?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  You — is that a serious question?<br><br>Q    It is absolutely a serious question.  Do you trust the Taliban? <br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  No, I do not.<br><br>Q    Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  No, I do not trust the Taliban. <br><br>Q    So why are you handing the country over?<br><br>Q    Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country?<br><br>Q    Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please?  Will you amplify your answer, please — why you don’t trust the Taliban?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a — it’s a silly question.  Do I trust the Taliban?  No.  But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more re- — more competent in terms of conducting war. <br><br>Yes, ma’am.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  You know my record.  I can tell by the way you asked the question.<br><br>I opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan.  I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall — it came to light after the administration was over, last — our administration — no nation has ever unified Afghanistan.  No nation.  Empires have gone there and not done it.<br><br>The focus we had — and I strongly support it — and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan.  I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was — allegedly escaped or — out of harm’s way.<br><br>We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time.  The second reason was to eliminate al Qaeda’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory.  We accomplished both of those objectives — period.<br><br>That’s what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan.  That job had been over for some time.  And that’s why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, has the civilian government hailed the people of Afghanistan?<br><br>Q    Mr. President, thank you very much.  Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  That is not true. <br><br>Q    Is it — can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not? <br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  That is not true.  They did not — they didn’t — did not reach that conclusion. <br><br>Q    So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse? <br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  The Afghan government and leadership has to come together.  They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place.  The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it?  It’s not a question of whether they have the capacity.  They have the capacity.  They have the forces.  They have the equipment.  The question is: Will they do it? <br><br>And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus- — walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force.  We are.  We’re going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in — in the region.  But — but, there’s not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban. <br><br>I believe the only way there’s going to be — this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community — the only way there’s ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace. <br><br>And the likelihood there’s going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, thank you.  But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller.  He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war.  So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Look, you’ve said two things — one, that if it could result in a civil war — that’s different than the Taliban succeeding, number one.  Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated — is going to implicate the entire region as well.  There’s a number of countries who have a grave concern about what’s going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security. <br><br>The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement?  That’s when that judgement will be made. <br><br>Q    Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan.  Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling —<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  None whatsoever.  Zero.  What you had is — you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy — six, if I’m not mistaken. <br><br>The Taliban is not the south — the North Vietnamese army. They’re not — they’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability.  There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the — of the United States from Afghanistan.  It is not at all comparable. <br><br>Q    And, Mr. President —<br><br>Q    Mr. President, can I —<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll take him and then I’ll — and then I’ll go — I’ll go to the other side.  Hang on a second.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing there?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, the mission hasn’t failed, yet.  There is in Afghanistan — in all parties, there’s been corruption.  The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose?  What is the objective? <br><br>For example, it started off — there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government.  That — that of — it didn’t come to — it didn’t come to fruition. <br><br>So the question now is, where do they go from here?  That — the jury is still out.  But the likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely. <br><br>Yes, ma’am.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a —<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  No.<br><br>Q    — military exit?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no.  It’s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them.  No country has ever been able to do that. <br><br>Keep in mind, as a student of history, as I’m sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history.  Not in all of its history.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, if this isn’t a “mission accomplished” moment, what is it, in your view?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  No, there’s no “mission accomplished.” <br><br>Q    How would you describe it?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  The mission was accomplished in that we get — got Osama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, if “speed is safety,” as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals?  Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Well, much of it has already happened.  There’s already been people — about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home — come to the United States already on commercial aircraft.  So, as I said, there’s over 2,500 people that as — from January to now, have gotten those visas.  And only half decided that they wanted to leave. <br><br>The point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas.<br><br>Q    Why can’t the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Because the law doesn’t allow that to happen.  And that’s why we’re asking the Congress to consider changing the law. <br><br>But in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to — to — and hopefully, while they’re waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that’s what they choose to do.<br><br>Q    And what do you make — and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today?<br><br>Q    Mr. President, I’m from Afghanistan.  I am Afghan (inaudible) woman.  Any message — good message for Afghan women in future?  Because they have achievement — they are really concerned about their achievement. <br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  They are very concerned, with good reason. <br><br>Q    Yes.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  When I was in Afghanistan — I’ve been there a number of times — I remember being in a school outside and — and, by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, a — an area in the middle that is sort of like — it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it. <br><br>And I remember saying to — speaking to a group of young women — I guess they were roughly — don’t hold me to this — they look like they’d be 14, 15 years old.  And they’re in school, and there’s a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know. <br><br>And I said, “You know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and that terrorists didn’t amass again to — to go after our country.  And then we’re going to have to leave.”  And a young woman said, “You can’t leave.  You can’t leave.”  It was — it was heartbreaking.  “You can’t leave,” she said.  “I want to be a doctor.  I want to be a doctor.  I want to be a doctor.  If you leave, I’ll never be able to be a doctor.”  Well, that’s why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that.  If every work —<br><br>Well, anyway — so, yes, I’m aware. <br><br>I’m going to take one more question.<br><br>Q    Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal?<br><br>Q    (Inaudible) the Taliban being in Russia today — the Taliban —<br><br>Q    Mr. — Mr. President, I — thank you.  I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you’ve spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you’ve seen in 20 years.  How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent there?<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they’re not even close in terms of their capacity. <br><br>I was making the point — the point was that here we were; I was — the argument is, “Well, we could stay because no one was dying.  No Americans are being shot.  So why leave?”  Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before.  Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, the government.  More than they were.<br><br>The point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren’t going to go after them.  That was the point I was making. <br><br>Thank you all so very much.  Thank you.<br><br>2:34 P.M.

(Photo by Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA)No Use Germany.<br>ORDER FROM CHAOS<br>What do Americans think of the Russia-Ukraine war and of the US response?<br>Shibley Telhami Thursday, March 31, 2022<br>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has generated much debate in America, not only about what how the U.S. should respond, but also about the extent to which the invasion represents a threat to democracy. There have been questions about the extent to which Russia’s assault has galvanized public support behind NATO, whether the war has ended the post-Cold War era as we have known it, and about the nature of the Biden administration’s response. It has also generated discussion about the degree to which the Russia-Ukraine war has eroded the deep American partisan divide in recent years. I set out to probe public perceptions of these issues in a new poll.<br><br>It turns out that large majorities of Americans are indeed following the Russian invasion closely, according to our University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll. The poll was carried out online between March 16 to 28, 2022 by Nielsen Scarborough, who used a nationally representative sample of 1,320 adults with a margin of error of +/- 2.7%. It found that 40% of respondents say they are following the crisis “very closely,” and another 45% say they are following somewhat closely. Here are twelve takeaways:<br><br>1<br>Americans clearly view Ukraine as being far more friendly than Russia, even if most Americans don’t simply consider Russia to be an enemy or Ukraine to be a full ally. Thirty-four percent of respondents say Russia is an enemy, including 30% of Republicans and 40% of Democrats, while 38% say Russia is an “unfriendly country,” and 24% say it is neither friendly nor unfriendly. Nineteen percent consider Ukraine an ally, while a slight majority of 54% consider Ukraine a “friendly country,” and 25% consider it neither friendly nor unfriendly.<br><br>2<br>Large bipartisan majorities remain opposed to sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, even if the conflict persists. Sixty-five percent oppose sending troops, including 68% of Republicans and 62% of Democrats. At the same time, a large majority, 83%, supports supplying the Ukrainian army with military equipment, including 82% of Republicans and 86% of Democrats. Similarly, 89% of those polled support continuing to impose tough sanctions on Russia, including 85% of Republicans and 95% of Democrats.<br><br>3<br>If the Russian invasion persists, small bipartisan majorities will support a no-fly zone over Ukraine, even as large majorities of Americans express concern about the possibility of fighting Russians and of nuclear conflict. Fifty-six percent of respondents say they support enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, including 52% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats. Despite this view, most respondents also expressed overwhelming concern about potential U.S. military confrontation with Russia (61% were “very” concerned and another 28% were “somewhat concerned”). Nuclear fears also weighed heavily: 58% were also “very concerned” and another 24% “somewhat concerned” about potential nuclear confrontation with Russia.<br><br>4<br>Americans view the U.S. response to the Ukraine crisis more favorably than unfavorably but are divided in their attitude along party lines. Forty-nine percent say their opinion of the U.S. reaction has been favorable, including 31% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats, compared to 31% who express unfavorable opinions, including 49% of Republicans and 13% of Democrats. A further 20% express neither favorable nor unfavorable opinions. Most Americans, 51%, say the U.S. reacted at the “appropriate level,” but a majority of Republicans, 56%, say the U.S. has “underreacted.” Two-thirds of Americans support U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to end importing Russian energy, including 56% of Republicans and 80% of Democrats.<br><br>5<br>Most Americans, including majorities of Democrats and Republicans, say they are prepared to pay some price in energy costs and inflation for supporting Ukraine, but not in American lives. Seventy-three percent say they are at least somewhat prepared to pay higher energy costs, including 88% of Democrats and 58% of Republicans, while 65% are at least somewhat prepared to see increased inflation, including 78% of Democrats and 51% of Republicans. At the same time, 68% of Americans are “not at all” (41%) or “not much” (27%) prepared to accept loss of lives of U.S. troops. This holds across the partisan American divide, but Republicans are much more likely to “not at all” accept casualties (47%), compared to Democrats (33%).<br><br>6<br>U.S. policy toward Ukraine has impacted the public perceptions of Biden and former President Donald Trump more negatively than positively, driven by highly partisan attitudes. Thirty-six percent say they now have more favorable views of Biden, 23% say their views are unaffected, while 41% say they have more negative views, including 80% of Republicans. Thirty-four percent say they now have more positive views of Trump, 26% say their views were unaffected, while 40%, including 72% of Democrats, say they have more negative views of Trump.<br><br>7<br>Although U.S. government messaging on Ukraine has been partly focused on defending democracy around the world, most Americans across the partisan divide don’t believe the U.S. is now a good model for democracy. Only 27% say that democracy in the U.S. is a good example for other countries to follow, including 28% of Democrats and 29% of Republicans. A large majority, 61%, say the U.S. “used to be a good example but has not been in recent years”, including 64% of Republicans and 58% of Democrats.<br><br>8<br>Americans are divided on whether their country should be leading the international opposition to the Russian invasion, with 47% saying the U.S. should be the one to lead (42% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats), while 53% say it should not (58% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats).<br><br>9<br>Overwhelmingly, Americans across the partisan divide blame Russia for the crisis and few blame Ukraine. At the same time, a significant percentage also blame the U.S. Ninety-eight percent say Russia is to blame, 29% say Ukraine bears at least some of the blame, and 36% say the U.S. bears at least some of the blame, including half of Republicans.<br><br>10<br>While Americans say NATO’s expansion played a role in Russian behavior, most don’t think this was the key to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Thirty-eight percent say the expansion of NATO played a key role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 41% say NATO expansion played “a small but not a key role,” while 21% say it played no role.<br><br>11<br>Most Americans (57%) say the post-Cold War era has ended. Among those who hold that view, most blame Russian behavior, but a smaller majority also blame American behavior. Ninety-two percent say Russian behavior contributed to the demise of the post-Cold War era (64% say “a lot” and 28% say “somewhat”), while 73% say American behavior contributed (30% say “a lot” while 43% say “somewhat”).<br><br>12<br>Americans support receiving Ukrainian refugees in small or moderate numbers but oppose unlimited numbers. Twenty percent say the U.S. should accept “small” numbers, 36% would accept “moderate” numbers, and 30% would accept refugees without a limit, including 45% of Democrats and 16% of Republicans. Fourteen percent would not accept any refugees, including 20% of Republicans and 7% of Democrats.<br><br>The Ukraine crisis has managed to eliminate or narrow the deep American partisan divide on several issues, including what steps the U.S. should take, and how much the public is prepared to pay for confronting the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But on issues that bear directly on electoral politics, such as evaluating the Biden administration’s response, and attitudes toward Biden and Trump, the deep American partisan divide appears to be less affected by the war.<br><br>It is striking that, unlike their leaders, large majorities of Americans across the partisan divide no longer view American democracy as providing a good example for the world. It is also notable that a slight majority of Americans does not want to see the U.S. take the lead in confronting the crisis; and that, one month into Russia’s war in Ukraine, most Americans are still reluctant to call Russia an “enemy” and Ukraine an “ally.”<br><br>MORE<br><br>ORDER FROM CHAOS<br>As Biden administration’s defense budget and National Defense Strategy emerge, concerns abound<br>Kelly McElveny<br>Wednesday, April 13, 2022<br><br>RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE<br>Escalation aversion in Ukraine: Nuclear and conventional risks<br>Amy J.

Feel free to ask me for review after a game if you think that may be useful for you. <br><br><br><br><br>　　How did I meet "Go"------It happened 40 years ago, when I was a rosy-cheeked high school student.<br>One of my classmate knew "Go".  We used to play "Shogi" but on one hand he taught me "Go" rules. <br>    Talk about "Shogi",I was proud of myself as unbeatable,so my "Go" partner lost every "Shogi" match.<br>Naturally, we switched to "Go".      Sometime, we played all night then went to school together. <br> However,it seems my "Go" didn't brush up so much in my school days.<br>    When I entered company, there were many "Go" or "Shogi" freek as co-worker. They played "Go" or "Shogi" during every break (morning, lunch, and tea time). So did I, so at last I came to scramble for No 1sheat in my company.  <br>    Now I have none to play with in my company, so I go to public hall or "Go club" every weekend.<br>I'm sure that I am "Gokichi"-a crazy "Go" fan.<br>    Last year I started playing internet, and it allowed me to have more occasion.  But I'm still on third "Dan"<br> I wonder if I can be much better?<br> <br><br>  <br><br><br><br><br>arndt: ah, well, that's allowed<br>brexitLOL: all the best women are married<br>brexitLOL: discuss<br>OwyheeMud: Ben Franklin is said to have written a piece in praise of older women<br>arndt: there's a word starts with dis-...<br>OwyheeMud: married women will offer many of the same niceties<br>OwyheeMud: from the male point of view, many would be happy that the married woman is someone else's problem<br>OwyheeMud: I was married once and for a time<br>OwyheeMud: we each agreed that we had each married poorly<br>peanatsu: ah, so she dumped you<br>OwyheeMud: i managed to arrange that<br>OwyheeMud: in self defense<br>Genghis: MGTOW is the future<br>Mukti: MGTOW?<br>Genghis: Men Going their own way<br>Mukti: Ah, thx :-)<br>Genghis: Divorce destroys men<br>mewtwo123: I'm a guy who doesn't want to get married but I don't identify as MGTOW because MGTOW on the internet refers to those people who write blogs to complain about not having a good dating life while not improving their atttitude,<br>OwyheeMud: nah, men are really good at messing ourselves up with or without any help<br>peanatsu: marriage used to be kind of like a contract of ownership of women<br>peanatsu: now with equal rights it seems obsolete<br>Mukti: Going ones's own way is fun often, but most things are nicer with a partner.<br>Genghis: Sure but getting married and then financially destroyed in divorce court isn't worth the risk<br>Mukti: I think its is :-)<br>OwyheeMud: avoid progeny, secure prenuptial contracts<br>Genghis: Well I am married too,  soo. . . . <br>Genghis: Children supersede prenupts<br>OwyheeMud: anyone want to chat about go?<br>Mukti: ICool idea, OWM.<br>OwyheeMud: Children are not parties to prenuptial contracts<br>Mukti: I like parties.<br>OwyheeMud: as ever, I've got an offer up for new players in Beginners' Room<br>mewtwo123: I honestly don't want to get married because if I get married I don't think I'll be able to play video games for 8 hours a day anymore.<br>Genghis: yep, the divorce court decides what the children get<br>OwyheeMud: thus, avoid progeny until you are convinced that it is exactly the right thing to do<br>peanatsu: I am pregnant and dont know who to talk to about this<br>Genghis: and the debt is not dischargable by bankruptcy<br>Mukti: If you were happlily married you would'nt want to play video game sfor 8 hours anymore, Mewto123.<br>mewtwo123: If I had to choose between marriage and video games, I pick video games.

But I don't need a marriage certificate to show I love her. (Also can't afford a ring)<br>nari: did someone really say they're pregnate? >_<;;<br>mewtwo123: Mukti, what's wrong with saying "good game" after someone admitted they played poorly? I say "good game" at the end of the game no matter what.<br>mewtwo123: Even if it was misclick game, I say good game.<br>Mukti: It seems cynical and abusive to me.<br>Mukti: It depend son the situation though.<br>Mukti: Why say that someone played well when he obviously did not?<br>Mukti: It's like rubbing salt in a wound.<br>mewtwo123: I automatically say good game at the end of every game, even if I misclicked or opponent misclicked. It's just what I say, there's no negative intention to mock there.<br>Mukti: It was not intended at you, mewtwo133, thee are those who abuse it.<br>Genghis: sometimes you just resign and disappear loki<br>mewtwo123: Okay Mukti.<br>Mukti: BTW, why do you ask, Mewto123?<br>mewtwo123: Just curious about the reason why you thought it was rude.<br>Mukti: how did you know I dislked that?<br>mewtwo123: It was on your profile.<br>Mukti: Ah, I see, it;s sin my profile somwehere.<br>Mukti: Well, my impression was, he was not as gracious as yo are, mewto123. But maybe I was wrong. i will remove the comment.<br>mewtwo123: I see. I don't judge, I was just curious.<br>Mukti: I know. Maybe, in hindsight, considering what you just said, I was too judgmental. Maybe he did not mean anything by it. <br>Mukti: Anyway going to watch TinTin. Have a nice evening all.<br>mewtwo123: Do svidaniya<br>Mukti: Do svidanya, vsevo xoroshevo.<br>Taro: Reminder: Today's KGS Plus teaching game with solaris is scheduled to begin in  20 minutes!<br>Taro: Correction: solaris will not be able to make it to the teaching game, but Cornel will kindly teach in his stead. :-)<br>Taro: Today's teaching game with Cornel Burzo 6D is now starting!

Is there a workaround for that?<br>darkronin: no, it's integral part of the user experience<br>xpfoup: by "opening a game", i mean clicking on "custom game" - so if i load a game, the "open game" will close, and i'll have to create again a game with "custom game"<br>darkronin: what if you try to do vice versa? open the game, then click on Custom game?<br>tomicus: whut?<br>darkronin: we're trying to beat the system<br>tomicus: just use an sgf editor, come on people<br>xpfoup: yep the vice versa works, but then once finished looking at the game, if still waiting for an opponent, i'll have this issue again<br>First: Tom don't help<br>tomicus: lol<br>Sheriffi: don't<br>xpfoup: yeah sgf editor would be fine, but i have to save the game to disk before, thanks anyway<br>darkronin: some laziness may have been detected<br>tomicus: see?

We used to play "Shogi" but on one hand he taught me "Go" rules. <br>    Talk about "Shogi",I was proud of myself as unbeatable,so my "Go" partner lost every "Shogi" match.<br>Naturally, we switched to "Go".      Sometime, we played all night then went to school together. <br> However,it seems my "Go" didn't brush up so much in my school days.<br>    When I entered company, there were many "Go" or "Shogi" freek as co-worker. They played "Go" or "Shogi" during every break (morning, lunch, and tea time). So did I, so at last I came to scramble for No 1sheat in my company.  <br>    Now I have none to play with in my company, so I go to public hall or "Go club" every weekend.<br>I'm sure that I am "Gokichi"-a crazy "Go" fan.<br>    Last year I started playing internet, and it allowed me to have more occasion.  But I'm still on third "Dan"<br> I wonder if I can be much better?<br> <br><br>  <br><br><br><br><br>arndt: ah, well, that's allowed<br>brexitLOL: all the best women are married<br>brexitLOL: discuss<br>OwyheeMud: Ben Franklin is said to have written a piece in praise of older women<br>arndt: there's a word starts with dis-...<br>OwyheeMud: married women will offer many of the same niceties<br>OwyheeMud: from the male point of view, many would be happy that the married woman is someone else's problem<br>OwyheeMud: I was married once and for a time<br>OwyheeMud: we each agreed that we had each married poorly<br>peanatsu: ah, so she dumped you<br>OwyheeMud: i managed to arrange that<br>OwyheeMud: in self defense<br>Genghis: MGTOW is the future<br>Mukti: MGTOW?<br>Genghis: Men Going their own way<br>Mukti: Ah, thx :-)<br>Genghis: Divorce destroys men<br>mewtwo123: I'm a guy who doesn't want to get married but I don't identify as MGTOW because MGTOW on the internet refers to those people who write blogs to complain about not having a good dating life while not improving their atttitude,<br>OwyheeMud: nah, men are really good at messing ourselves up with or without any help<br>peanatsu: marriage used to be kind of like a contract of ownership of women<br>peanatsu: now with equal rights it seems obsolete<br>Mukti: Going ones's own way is fun often, but most things are nicer with a partner.<br>Genghis: Sure but getting married and then financially destroyed in divorce court isn't worth the risk<br>Mukti: I think its is :-)<br>OwyheeMud: avoid progeny, secure prenuptial contracts<br>Genghis: Well I am married too,  soo. . . . <br>Genghis: Children supersede prenupts<br>OwyheeMud: anyone want to chat about go?<br>Mukti: ICool idea, OWM.<br>OwyheeMud: Children are not parties to prenuptial contracts<br>Mukti: I like parties.<br>OwyheeMud: as ever, I've got an offer up for new players in Beginners' Room<br>mewtwo123: I honestly don't want to get married because if I get married I don't think I'll be able to play video games for 8 hours a day anymore.<br>Genghis: yep, the divorce court decides what the children get<br>OwyheeMud: thus, avoid progeny until you are convinced that it is exactly the right thing to do<br>peanatsu: I am pregnant and dont know who to talk to about this<br>Genghis: and the debt is not dischargable by bankruptcy<br>Mukti: If you were happlily married you would'nt want to play video game sfor 8 hours anymore, Mewto123.<br>mewtwo123: If I had to choose between marriage and video games, I pick video games.

He has replaced the microblogging site’s cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who in his exit letter appreciated the decade-long work of the IIT-Bombay alumnus in different roles in the company. Agrawal had joined Twitter in 2011 as an ads engineer and had been promoted to the role of chief technology officer (CTO) in 2017.<br><br>While Twitter was always accused of not being able to control hate speech on its platform, troubles for the company increased in the post-Trump era in the US and other parts of the world, when activists and policymakers started accusing the company of being a tool in the hands of political parties.<br><br><br>Related Stories<br>After taking over as CTO, Agrawal’s main focus was on using AI and ML to identify hate speech and bots that were used to spread misinformation through the microblogging site. In 2018, Twitter was removing upto one million bot or fake accounts from its platform.<br><br><br>In 2019, Twitter announced the acquisition of ML startup Fabula AI to improve its ability to detect and control misinformation online. <br><br>Latest Issue<br>Outlook India<br>What Ignites Hatred In The Belly?<br>What Ignites Hatred In The Belly?<br>The new welfarism as part of the neoliberal reforms undertaken in early 1990s is yet to ensure that all citizens receive enough nutritious food<br><br>Indigenous Food: The Not-So-Secret Ingredient For Sustainability<br>BY GAUTAM BISHT<br>Sometimes, the way food gets positioned socially may have no relation to how science determines its nutritional value.<br><br>Food Apartheid: Non-vegetarians Not Allowed!<br>That Bitter Taste: When Food Becomes A Political Weapon<br>BY ASHUTOSH BHARDWAJ<br>Food becomes a tool of politics when it acquires ethical messages of abstention or becomes a culinary aesthetic<br><br>Goa On The Menu: Food And Family Through Time<br>Culinary slices of life involving a matronly figure and her brood<br><br>Food Insecurity: No Prayer For The Malnourished<br>In a VentureBeat Transform Conference in 2020, Agrawal spoke at length about the use of bots on Twitter and how they impacted the experience of humans on the platform. According to Agrawal, the most harmful are those that manage to disguise themselves successfully as humans using the most advanced conversational AI. “These mislead people into believing that they’re real people and allow people to be influenced by them,” he said at the conference.<br><br>It was in Agrawal’s tenure as CTO of Twitter that the company made news for labelling tweets of then US President Donald Trump as misleading or violent. The same technology has been used in other parts of the world, including India, where from time to time, Twitter, on the basis of feedback from its ML filters, weeds out or labels tweets that spread misinformation.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Action In India<br><br>Agrawal’s war against misinformation has continued unabated in India as well, where the Company has taken bold decisions, putting it in direct confrontation with the government. In May this year, a tweet by BJP politician and member of Parliament Sambit Patra was flagged as ‘Manipulated Media’, drawing government’s ire.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>However, Twitter stood its ground, leading to police visiting its officers in Delhi-NCR in a pressure building tactic on the US based company. The company had also suspended the account of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi for tweeting a pic of the parents of a rape victim. Interestingly, both the opposition and the ruling government have accused Twitter of favouring serving the agenda of their political rivals.<br><br>Now that Agrawal has been made the CEO of the company, it would be interesting to see the approach of the microblogging site towards the issue of hate speech, and fake news on its platform, especially in the backdrop of upcoming elections in key Indian states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>TAGS<br>Business Twitter Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal Jack Dorsey<br>PREVIOUS STORY<br>Behind The Scenes Of HUL’s 8.6 % Net Profit Rise In Q4Behind The Scenes Of HUL’s 8.6 % Net Profit Rise In Q4<br>NEXT STORY<br>iPhones Worth Rs 47,000 Crore Likely To Be Made In India Under PLI Scheme: ReportiPhones Worth Rs 47,000 Crore Likely To Be Made In India Under PLI Scheme: Report<br><br>About Us Contact US Subscribe Advertising Rates Copyright & Disclaimer Poshan Newsscroll<br>outlook<br>Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube<br>Copyright ©2021 Outlook Publishing India Pvt.

At the time of the attack, the Hindu villagers lived in close proximity to Rohingya villagers, who are predominantly Muslim. Rakhine villagers, who are predominantly Buddhist, also lived in the same area.<br><br>ARSA militants in Myanmar's Rakhine State. © @ARSA_official via TwitterARSA militants in Myanmar's Rakhine State. © @ARSA_official via Twitter<br>ARSA militants in Myanmar's Rakhine State. © @ARSA_official via Twitter<br>Armed men dressed in black and local Rohingya villagers in plain clothes rounded up dozens of Hindu women, men and children.

Raj Kumari, 18, said: “They slaughtered the men. We were told not to look at them … They had knives. They also had some spades and iron rods. … We hid ourselves in the shrubs there and were able to see a little … My uncle, my father, my brother – they were all slaughtered.”<br><br>Formila, around 20, told Amnesty International that she did not see when the Hindu men were killed, but that the fighters “came back with blood on their swords, and blood on their hands” and told the women the men had been killed. Later, as Formila and the other seven abducted women were being marched away, she turned back and saw ARSA fighters kill the other women and children. “I saw men holding the heads and hair [of the women] and others were holding knives. And then they cut their throats,” she said.<br><br>According to a detailed list of the dead, given to Amnesty International, the victims from Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik include 20 men, 10 women, and 23 children, 14 of whom were under the age of eight. This is consistent with multiple testimonies the organization gathered in both Bangladesh and Myanmar, from survivors and witnesses as well as Hindu community leaders.<br><br>Part of a list given to Amnesty International by Hindu community leaders, giving details of 99 Hindus killed in two massacres in the Kha Maung Seik cluster of villages in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State on 25 August 2017. © Private© Private<br>Part of a list given to Amnesty International by Hindu community leaders, giving details of 99 Hindus killed in two massacres in the Kha Maung Seik cluster of villages in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State on 25 August 2017. © Private<br>The same day, all of the 46 Hindu men, women, and children in the neighbouring village of Ye Bauk Kyar disappeared.

The perpetrators of this heinous crime must be held to account,” said Tirana Hassan.<br><br>ARSA’s other unlawful killings of Hindus<br>Amnesty International has also documented ARSA’s involvement in other killings and violent attacks against members of other ethnic and religious communities.<br>On 26 August 2017, ARSA members killed six Hindus – two women, a man, and three children – and injured another Hindu woman on the outskirts of Maungdaw town, near Myo Thu Gyi village.<br><br>Kor Mor La, 25, was one of two women who survived the attack, along with four children. Her husband Na Ra Yan, 30, and five-year-old daughter Shu Nan Daw were both killed. “The people who shot us were dressed in black. … I couldn’t see their faces, only their eyes. … They had long guns and swords,” Kor Mor Lar said. “My husband was shot next to me. I was shot [in the chest]. After that I was barely conscious.”<br><br>The killings came just days after ARSA fighters unleashed a series of attacks on around 30 Myanmar security posts on 25 August 2017, prompting an unlawful and grossly disproportionate campaign of violence by Myanmar’s security forces. Amnesty International and others have documented in detail how this campaign was marked by killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, village burning, forced starvation tactics, and other violations which constitute crimes against humanity under international law. More than 693,000 Rohingya people were forced to flee to Bangladesh, where they still remain.<br><br>Tens of thousands of people from other ethnic and religious communities were also displaced within Rakhine State during the violence. Although most have returned to their homes, some continue to live in temporary shelters, either because their homes were destroyed or because they fear further ARSA attacks if they return to their villages.<br><br>Independent investigations needed<br>The Myanmar government cannot criticize the international community as being one-sided while at the same time denying access to northern Rakhine State.

The full extent of ARSA’s abuses and the Myanmar military’s violations will not be known until independent human rights investigators, including the UN Fact-Finding mission, are given full and unfettered access to Rakhine State,” said Tirana Hassan.<br><br> <br><br>Briefing: Attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on Hindus in northern Rakhine State<br>Early in the morning of 25 August 2017, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a Rohingya armed group, attacked around 30 security force outposts in northern Rakhine State. The attacks, which were carefully planned and coordinated, came just hours after the release of the final report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which had been tasked with identifying solutions for peace and development in one of Myanmar’s most underdeveloped and volatile regions.[1] In the days that followed, ARSA fighters, along with some mobilized Rohingya villagers, engaged in scores of clashes with security forces.[2]<br><br>The Myanmar security forces, and in particular the military, responded to the attacks and subsequent clashes with an unlawful and grossly disproportionate campaign of violence marked by killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture,[3] village burning, forced starvation tactics, and other human rights violations and crimes under international law, all of which has been well documented by Amnesty International and others.[4] The military’s attacks, which targeted the entire Rohingya population living in northern Rakhine State, have been both widespread and systematic, constituting crimes against humanity under international law. To date, some 693,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee to Bangladesh.[5]<br><br>Also known as Harakah al-Yaqin, or “the faith movement”, ARSA first came to prominence in October 2016 after launching similar, albeit smaller-scale, attacks on border police posts in northern Rakhine State, prompting a disproportionate military response also amounting to crimes against humanity.[6] The group was established in the aftermath of violence between Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State in 2012 and is comprised of a core group of trained fighters, estimated as in the hundreds, with access to small firearms and some home-made explosives. On 25 August, ARSA mobilized a large number of Rohingya villagers – likely around several thousand. The villagers were overwhelmingly armed with bladed weapons or sticks.[7] While Amnesty International has confirmed that some Rohingya villagers participated in ARSA attacks, the overwhelming majority of Rohingya did not. Even in the specific villages where attacks occurred, there is no question that most villagers did not take part in ARSA attacks.<br><br>Amnesty International has documented serious human rights abuses committed by ARSA during and after the attacks in late August 2017. This briefing focuses on serious crimes – including unlawful killings and abductions – carried out by ARSA fighters against the Hindu community living in northern Rakhine State. At the time of the unlawful killings, none of the victims were armed or endangering the lives of ARSA fighters or other Rohingya. In the refugee camps in Bangladesh in September 2017, Amnesty International conducted 12 interviews with members of the Hindu community who left Myanmar during the violence. In April 2018, Amnesty International conducted research in Sittwe, Myanmar on ARSA abuses and attacks, interviewing 10 additional people from the Hindu community and 33 people from ethnic Rakhine, Khami, Mro, and Thet communities, all of whom were from northern Rakhine State. Six more people from an area where Hindu killings occurred were interviewed by phone from outside the region in May 2018.<br><br>The full extent of human rights abuses by ARSA is difficult to determine, in large part because the Myanmar authorities continue to restrict access to northern Rakhine State. Access restrictions have made it extremely difficult for members of all ethnic minorities and religious communities still living in the region to speak about their experiences and to get the support and assistance they require. In addition, those who speak about ARSA abuses face threats and intimidation from the group. The killing of Rohingya suspected of acting as government informers throughout 2017, and reports of ARSA-related killings in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, have only heightened such fears.[8]<br><br>MASSACRE IN KHA MAUNG SEIK VILLAGE TRACT <br>At around 8 a.m. on 25 August 2017, ARSA attacked the Hindu community in the village of Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik, located in Kha Maung Seik village tract in northern Maungdaw Township. ARSA fighters, some of whom were dressed in black and others dressed in ordinary clothing, rounded up all 69 Hindu men, women, and children present in the village at the time. A few hours later, ARSA fighters killed, execution-style, the vast majority of them, and abducted the rest.<br><br>The same day, the Hindu community present in the neighbouring village of Ye Bauk Kyar – 46 men, women, and children – disappeared. To date, their fate and whereabouts remains unknown. Relatives and other members of the Hindu community in northern Rakhine State told Amnesty International that they presume the entire group was killed by the same perpetrators.[9]<br><br>Kha Maung Seik is a mixed-ethnicity and religion village tract, home to Hindu, Rohingya, and ethnic Rakhine villagers, all of whom lived in close proximity. Amnesty International conducted in-depth interviews in a Hindu refugee camp in Bangladesh in September 2017, and in the Rakhine State capital of Sittwe, Myanmar in April 2018, and by telephone in May 2018 with eight survivors, five family members of victims, three men who were part of the group that uncovered the mass graves, and several witnesses to related events in and around Kha Maung Seik, including ARSA attacks and the movements of Myanmar security forces.[10]<br><br>“[It was morning], I was praying at the time,” recalled 22-year-old Bina Bala,[11] who was one of eight women abducted and taken to Bangladesh by ARSA fighters. “They came to our house. Some were wearing black and others were wearing normal clothes … I recognized them [from the village].”[12]<br><br>Bina Bala said the men confiscated the family’s mobile phones before ordering them out in to the courtyard, where other Hindu villagers were also being gathered. She told Amnesty International, “[The men] held knives and long iron rods. They tied our hands behind our backs and blindfolded us. I asked what they were doing. One of them replied, ‘You and [ethnic] Rakhine are the same, you have a different religion, you can’t live here’. He spoke the [Rohingya] dialect. They asked what belongings we had, then they beat us. Eventually I gave them my gold and money.”[13]<br><br>Rika Dhar, 24, was also at home with her family at the time of the attack. “We didn’t have a chance to run,” she told Amnesty International. “Muslim people took our gold. … I was blindfolded, and they tied my hands behind my back.”[14] Like other women Amnesty International interviewed, Rika Dhar said she knew some of the attackers, who were members of the Rohingya community living in Kha Maung Seik village tract.<br><br>After binding, robbing, and blindfolding the Hindu villagers, ARSA fighters marched them to a creek area on the outskirts of the village. There, the fighters sat the villagers down and burned their ID cards, which they had confiscated earlier. They then divided the men from the women and children, and brought the women into the forest.[15]<br><br>The fighters killed, execution-style, 53 of the Hindus from Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik, according to a list of the dead seen by Amnesty International that is consistent with testimony from survivors, other Kha Maung Seik residents, and Hindu community leaders. The victims include 20 men, 10 women, and 23 children, 14 of who were under the age of 8.[16] Only 16 people – eight women and eight of their children – survived, their lives spared on the condition that the women agreed to “convert” from Hinduism to Islam and then marry people selected by ARSA fighters.[17]<br><br>According to all eight survivors, the ARSA fighters took the men away and killed them. Formila, around 20, told Amnesty International that “the Muslim men came back with blood on their swords, and blood on their hands. They told us that they had killed our husbands and the village headman.”[18] Raj Kumari, 18, said: “They slaughtered the men. We were told not to look at them … They had knives. They also had some spades and iron rods. … We hid ourselves in the shrubs there and were able to see a little. … My uncle, my father, my brother – they were all slaughtered. … After slaughtering the men, the women were also slaughtered.”[19]<br><br>Shortly after, a group of about 10 to 15 fighters took the eight survivors and their children and removed them from the larger group. The fighters then began to kill the other women and children. Two of the survivors – Aur Nika, around 18; and Formila – told Amnesty International that, as the fighters were leading them away, they looked back and saw women being killed.[20] Formila recalled, “I saw some Muslim men kill Hindu women. Then I cried. … I saw men holding the heads and hair [of the women] and others were holding knives. And then they cut their throats,” she said.[21] Bina Bala told Amnesty International that although she did not see the killings, she heard women and children screaming shortly after being taken away.[22]<br><br>The 16 survivors were held captive inside a house in the area for two nights, before being forced to flee alongside their captors to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.[23] According to five of the women, the group fled the same day helicopters were seen flying over the village.[24] The presence of helicopters in the area at the time was separately corroborated by San Nyunt, the Village Administrator from neighbouring Min Kha Maung; and by Shawlyee Shawltee, a 20-year-old woman who lived in Kha Maung Seik village tract but who had left her village on 24 August and was taking shelter in BGP post in Ah Shey Kha Maung Seik village at the time of the massacre.[25]<br><br>Shortly after arriving in Bangladesh on 28 August, the eight Hindu women were forced to make a false statement on video, claiming that the massacre had been carried out by ethnic Rakhine villagers.[26] “[One of the kidnappers] told us that if anyone asks we should say that the Rakhine and the military attacked us,” recalled Bina Bala. “He said if people come to interview you, you must say this or you will be killed.” [27] Soon after the video was posted on Facebook, members of the Hindu community in northern Rakhine State alerted friends in Bangladesh who proceeded to locate the survivors. The survivors were then relocated to a camp designated for Hindu refugees, where they were eventually protected by Bangladeshi security forces.[28] In early October, all sixteen survivors were repatriated to Myanmar with the support of the Bangladeshi and Myanmar authorities.[29]<br><br>On 23 September, members of the Hindu community in northern Rakhine State and members of the Myanmar security forces travelled to the site of the massacre and, over the course of two days, unearthed four mass graves, which in total contained the remains of 45 people.[30] On 27 September, the government temporarily lifted its ban on access to the area and brought local and international journalists to visit the site of the mass graves.[31]<br><br>According to the list that identified by name, biographical data, and village the 99 Hindus reportedly killed, given to Amnesty International by Hindu community leaders, all of the 45 excavated bodies have been identified as people from Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik or people who were visiting Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik at the time of the attack.[32] The bodies of the other eight people killed from Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik have not been found; according to the list of those killed, seven of those eight were young children – including four who were under three months old.[33] The fate and whereabouts of villagers from Ye Bauk Kyar remain unknown, although they are presumed to have been killed by the same perpetrators.<br><br>In a press statement posted on its Twitter account and in responses to media inquiries, ARSA has denied any involvement in the incident.[34] The Myanmar authorities’ restrictions on access mean no independent journalist or human rights investigator has been granted unfettered access to Kha Maung Seik and the surrounding areas. <br><br>Several of the survivors, including at least three of the eight interviewed by Amnesty International, have been interviewed multiple times by different media organizations. The vast majority of these interviews took place either in the Bangladesh refugee camps during the days after the women were rescued, or in Myanmar in the weeks after the mass graves were uncovered. Over the course of these interviews, the women provided accounts which were at times inconsistent with the testimony of other survivors and even contradicted their own previous statements.<br><br>As noted, the survivors’ initial declaration on video in Bangladesh placed the blame for the killings on ethnic Rakhine villagers,[35] as they did several days later in interviews with Reuters.[36] In subsequent interviews in Bangladesh with media and with Amnesty International, the survivors were at times equivocal about the identity of the perpetrators, and other times said it was ARSA, “Rohingya,” or “Muslims”; throughout this period, they typically described attackers as wearing black.[37] On their return to Myanmar, survivors unambiguously asserted that Rohingya, believed to be ARSA fighters, were responsible.[38] The survivors’ evolving stories made it difficult for journalists and human rights investigators – including Amnesty International – to come to a conclusion about the facts.<br><br>After careful review of evidence obtained in Bangladesh and Rakhine State, Amnesty International has concluded that ARSA fighters are responsible for the massacre.<br><br>First, the inconsistencies of the Hindu survivors’ testimonies are largely explained by the pressures and threats to personal safety that they faced while in Bangladesh, as described above by Bina Bala. Such pressure continued even while they lived in a separate camp area protected by the Bangladeshi security forces.<br><br>Second, the physical descriptions that the Hindu survivors provided of the ARSA attackers in Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik – descriptions which have largely remained consistent over time – are also consistent with descriptions of ARSA fighters around the time of the massacre from witnesses in other parts of Kha Maung Seik village tract and from witnesses in other villages across northern Rakhine State.<br><br>Ten Hindu in Ta Man Thar, Thit Tone Nar Gwa Son, and Myo Thu Gyi villages; three ethnic Mro residents of Khu Daing village, which was attacked and burned by ARSA on 28 August 2017; and two ethnic Rakhine residents of Koe Tan Kauk village tract all separately described to Amnesty International seeing a core group of fighters in black, often with their faces covered except for their eyes.[39] Many from those villages, as well as an ethnic Rakhine villager from Auk Pyue Ma, also described seeing among the attackers some Rohingya men who they recognized as neighbours or residents from nearby villages, similar to in Kha Maung Seik.[40] Witness descriptions of ARSA fighters covering their faces are likewise consistent with known photographs and videos of ARSA fighters, including those posted by ARSA itself in the weeks immediately before and after the 25 August attacks.[41]<br><br>Third, all of the survivors and many of the witnesses stated that they could hear the fighters speaking in the Rohingya dialect, which is very similar to the dialect spoken by the Hindu population in northern Rakhine State.[42]<br><br>Fourth, Amnesty International sent a forensic anthropological expert 31 photographs taken in Kha Maung Seik on 23 and 24 September 2017 by a person who was present when bodies were discovered in mass graves.[43] In a peer-reviewed analysis, the forensic expert concluded, after categorizing the decomposition of the bodies and estimating the soil temperature and water level, that “the appearance of the human remains exhumed from the grave at Kha Maung Seik on 24 September 2017 is entirely consistent with what would be expected had those individuals been killed and buried at that site on 25 August 2017.”[44]<br><br>The expert also identified the “presence of blindfolds on multiple victims (and the possible presence of sharp and blunt or projectile trauma), [which] is indicative of homicide in the form of extrajudicial and summary executions.”[45] When enlarging one of the images, the expert determined that a female victim “exhibits an injury to the anterior neck that is consistent with sharp force trauma, e.g. a knife slash to the throat,” though could not conclude from the photograph alone whether the trauma was the cause of death or had occurred during the excavation of the bodies.[46] The presence of blindfolds, as well as a wound suggestive of a throat being slit, is consistent with the testimonies of the surviving Hindu women.[47]<br><br>Fifth, testimonies from a Hindu villager and a Rakhine Village Administrator in Kha Maung Seik village tract confirms that the Myanmar military sent reinforcements to the area after the massacre was carried out, and the that at least one helicopter arrived in the area several days later, on 27 August.[48] That testimony gives further credence to the likelihood that the Myanmar security forces were not in control of Kha Maung Seik on the day the massacre occurred and therefore could not have carried it out.<br><br>Sixth, survivors identified specific individual perpetrators, one of whom Amnesty International was able to confirm was a Rohingya resident of Kha Maung Seik village tract.<br><br>Together, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that ARSA was responsible for the massacre, and that it has actively tried to cover up the crimes by forcing the surviving women to appear on camera implicating other perpetrators and through more general intimidation aimed at distorting the story.<br><br>The attack in Kha Maung Seik shook the Hindu community in Rakhine State. Many of those whom Amnesty International interviewed in Sittwe expressed concerns about further violence. “I never imagined this could happen, we had a good relationship [with the Rohingya]. Why did they attack us?” asked Shawlyee Shawltee, from Kha Maung Seik.[49] Like other people displaced during the violence, she is worried about the future and does not want to return to her village. “I lost everything, my house, all our property. My husband is suffering [psychologically] after all his family members died,” she said.[50]<br><br>UNLAWFULL KILLING OF SIX HINDUS IN MYO THU GYI<br>While the massacre in Kha Maung Seik village tract is the most egregious incident of human rights abuses by ARSA that Amnesty International has documented, fighters perpetrated other killings and violent attacks against members of Hindu and Buddhist ethnic groups. On 26 August 2017, ARSA fighters killed six Hindus – two women, a man, and three children – and injured another Hindu woman, on the outskirts of Maungdaw town, near Myo Thu Gyi village.<br><br>The six victims were part of an extended family of twelve who had fled from U Daung village tract, in Maungdaw Township, after ARSA fighters threatened them the day before. After seeking refuge for a night in the house of the ethnic Rakhine Village Administrator, the group was driven to the outskirts of Maungdaw town. Shortly after they arrived, a gunfight broke out between ARSA and the Myanmar military. The Hindu family took cover in a nearby building under construction. According to the only two adult survivors, men dressed in black and carrying guns entered the building and then proceed to shoot at the group at close range.[51]<br><br>Kor Mor La, 25, was one of the two women who survived the attack, along with four children. Her husband Na Ra Yan, 30, and 5-year-old daughter, Shu Nan Daw, were both killed. “The people who shot us were dressed in black. … I couldn’t see their faces, only their eyes. … They had long guns and swords,” Kor Mor Lar said. “My husband was shot next to me. I was shot [in the chest]. After that I was barely conscious.”[52]<br><br>Kor Mor La showed Amnesty International a scar on her left breast that she said was from the gunshot wound. “The bullet wound is still sore,” Kor Mor La said, explaining that she had to visit a doctor for ongoing treatment.[53]<br><br>Phaw Naw Balar, 27, was the only other adult to survive the attack. She told Amnesty International, “The men wearing black came from the direction of Myo Thu Gyi village. They didn’t say anything, they just started shooting. After they left, my children were crying, so I took them to the next floor up and we hid together in an empty water tank.”[54]<br><br>She explained that they hid until the ARSA fighters had left the area. “When I came back downstairs, I saw the dead bodies,” she recalled. “Six of my relatives were dead. Some had been shot in the front, in their abdomen and chest, [and] others in the back. My sister-in-law [Kor Mor La] was shot. I tried to bandage her, then we left for the three mile checkpoint.”[55] From there, the group travelled to Buthidaung town, and then on to Sittwe, where Kor Mor La received treatment for her injuries. In addition to Kor Mor La’s husband and daughter, ARSA fighters killed Chou Maw Tet, 27; her husband Han Mon Tor, 30; the couple’s 10-year-old son, Praw Chat; and their 3-year-old daughter, Daw Maw Ne.[56]<br><br>Today, the two surviving woman and their four children remain displaced in Sittwe, where they are living in a Hindu temple. Without her husband, the breadwinner of the family, Kor Mo La explained that she is worried how her family will survive. “I have had a very difficult time,” she said. “I have two children, just trying to survive is very hard. We are suffering so much.”[57]<br><br>CONCLUSION<br>The Rohingya in Rakhine State have for decades suffered systematic discrimination by the Myanmar authorities. Amnesty International has concluded that the deeply discriminatory way the authorities treated the Rohingya, even before the atrocities from August 2017 onwards, amounted to the crime against humanity of apartheid. Following the 25 August attacks these violations and crimes reached a peak, with unlawful killings, rapes, and burning of villages on a large scale, leading the majority of the population to flee the country. Nothing can justify such violations. But similarly, no atrocities can justify the massacre, abductions, and other abuses committed by ARSA against the Hindu community, as documented in this briefing.<br><br>Since the outbreak of violence in August, the Myanmar authorities have refused to grant access to northern Rakhine State to Amnesty International and other independent investigators, which has made it incredibly difficult to access those communities affected by ARSA and to corroborate witness accounts. Despite the restrictions, Amnesty International has now determined that ARSA fighters are responsible for the unlawful killing and abduction of members of the Hindu community in northern Rakhine State. These are serious crimes and abuses of human rights. They should be investigated by a competent body, and where sufficient, admissible evidence is found, those responsible should be held to account before independent civilian courts, in trials which meet international standards of fairness and which do not impose the death penalty.<br><br>For the full extent of the human rights abuses and crimes committed in northern Rakhine State to be uncovered, including those committed by ARSA, the Myanmar authorities must immediately allow independent investigators, including the UN Fact-Finding Mission, full and unfettered access throughout the region. Victims, survivors, and their families have the right to justice, truth, and reparation for the harm they have suffered. To this end, the authorities must also ensure full and unfettered humanitarian assistance to communities in need, and ensure that proper psycho-social support is available to all survivors of violence in northern Rakhine State.<br><br>[1] See International Crisis Group, Statement: Myanmar Tips into New Crisis after Rakhine State Attacks, 27 August 2017; International Crisis Group, Myanmar’s Rohingya Crisis Enters a Dangerous New Phase, Report No. 292 / Asia, 7 December 2017.<br><br>[2] Amnesty International interviews, Myanmar, April 2018.

This presents challenges, as the original name was often burmanized and then anglicized in the course of transliteration. While Amnesty International has tried to record the spelling of names as accurately as possible, it is likely some spellings deviate from the original. In reporting by local and international media outlets, there are often small spelling differences in the names of Hindu individuals interviewed multiple times, reflecting the same challenge. Amnesty International has on file more complete biographical data of each individual interviewed.  <br><br>[12] Amnesty International interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 27 April 2018.<br><br>[13] Amnesty International interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 27 April 2018.<br><br>[14] Amnesty International interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 25 April 2018.<br><br>[15] Amnesty International interviews, Hindu refugee camp in Bangladesh, 28 September 2017, and in Sittwe, Myanmar, 25-30 April 3018; and telephone interviews, Rakhine State, Myanmar, 17-21 May 2018.<br><br>[16] List of Hindu killed in Kha Maung Seik village tract, on file with Amnesty International.<br><br>[17] Amnesty International interviews with survivors, Hindu refugee camp in Bangladesh, 14 and 28 September 2017, and in Sittwe, Myanmar, 25-30 April 2018; and telephone interviews with survivors, Sittwe, Myanmar, 17 May 2018.<br><br>[18] Amnesty International telephone interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 17 May 2018.<br><br>[19] Amnesty International interview, Hindu refugee camp in Bangladesh, 28 September 2017.<br><br>[20] Amnesty International telephone interviews, Sittwe, Myanmar, 17 May 2018.<br><br>[21] Amnesty International telephone interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 17 May 2018.<br><br>[22] Amnesty International interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 27 April 2018.<br><br>[23] Amnesty International interviews with survivors, Hindu refugee camp in Bangladesh, 14 and 28 September 2017, and in Sittwe, Myanmar, 25-30 April 2018; and telephone interviews with survivors, Sittwe, Myanmar, 17 May 2018.<br><br>[24] Amnesty International interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 29 April 2018; and telephone interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 17 May 2018.<br><br>[25] Amnesty International interview, Sittwe, Myanmar, 29 April 2018; and telephone interview, 14 May 2018.<br><br>[26] Several people posted the video to Facebook, including here: https://www.facebook.com/noman.alhossain.9/videos/1405458619572008/ (last accessed 18 May 2018).

He is also producing the feature along with Sara Ramaker and Hughes. The project will mark the inaugural film from Snoop’s Death Row Pictures, which he runs with Ramaker.<br><br><br>Related Stories<br>MAC Cosmetics, MeUndies 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Collections<br>LIFESTYLE<br>The Best 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Merch to Gift for the Holidays<br>“I waited a long time to put this project together because I wanted to choose the right director, the perfect writer, and the greatest movie company I could partner with that could understand the legacy that I’m trying to portray on screen, and the memory I’m trying to leave behind,” said Snoop in a statement. “It was the perfect marriage. It was holy matrimony, not holy macaroni.” <br><br>Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr., shot to fame in the early 1990s West Coast rap scene thanks to his collaborations with Dr. Dre and then his one-two-punch albums, Doggystyle and The Doggfather. He parlayed that into a media and business empire, becoming an actor, DJ and media personality as well as an entrepreneur with ties to technology, global consumer brands, food and beverage industries, and, of course, the cannabis world.<br><br>With 35 million albums sold worldwide, he is a 17-time Grammy nominee, an American Music Award winner, and a Primetime Emmy Award winner. He has played himself in countless series and appeared in movies such as Training Day, Starsky & Hutch and this summer’s Jamie Foxx vampire action movie Day Shift.<br><br>“Snoop Dogg’s life and legacy make him one of the most exciting and influential icons in popular culture,” stated Donna Langley, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. “We met with Snoop shortly after he acquired Death Row Records and had the opportunity to hear his story in his own words. We are humbled to be able to create the lasting document of this singular artist.” <br><br>Universal has had previous success tapping into rap culture with musical biopics focusing on key artists. In 2015, it released Straight Outta Compton, centered on the West Coast hip-hop scene and N.W.A, the seminal group that Dr. Dre was a part of. The film grossed over $200 million and earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. With 2002’s 8 Mile, it told a thinly veiled autobiographical story of Eminem and his rise in an industry and genre dominated by Black artists. That movie grossed over $250 million and won the Oscar for best original song with “Lose Yourself.”<br><br><br>With the Snoop biopic in development, Universal will now have a trifecta of the artists — Snoop, Dr. Dre and Eminem — who performed during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.<br><br>Hughes and his brother, both born in Detroit and raised in Southern California, made their names by telling stories of the Black experience with Menace and Dead Presidents at the same time as Snoop was making his rise. In 2017, he tackled the music scene by directing The Defiant Ones, the award-winning four-part HBO documentary focused on Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine.<br><br>“Snoop Dogg is one of the most internationally beloved figures in hip-hop,” states Hughes. “There’s just something about his energy that brings people of all walks of life together. Snoop Dogg, not just the artist, but the man and his brand, has transcended generations with his connection and appeal to audiences. His story is so authentic and utterly inspiring, and to have the opportunity to tell his story allows me to go back to the hood 30 years after Menace II Society, and say more now than I could then.”<br><br>Cole is a generation younger than Snoop and Hughes and grew up influenced by their work as he made his mark as a screenwriter. He’s notably worked with Ryan Coogler on the two Black Panther movies as well as being a writer-producer on the Emmy-winning FX series American Crime Story: The People vs. OJ Simpson; he received an Emmy nomination for writing the episode “The Race Card.” <br><br>“I’ve been a fan of Snoop since Deep Cover,” says Cole. “His music and the films of Allen Hughes have left an indelible mark on me over my life.  What excites me most is the humanity of Snoop’s journey to international icon. Universal has proven they can guide a movie like this to something special. I’m proud to be a part of the team.”<br><br>NBCUniversal’s president of music and publishing, Mike Knobloch, will supervise the project’s music.  Universal’s senior vp production and development Ryan Jones will oversee the project for the studio.<br><br>Snoop is repped by Stephen Barnes of Morris Yorn.

Trump called out the Biden Administration Monday after the White House and Secret Service claimed that there are no guest logs from Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, residence, where his personal attorneys have discovered classified documents.In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump dubbed Biden’s garage, where classified material was discovered next to his cherished Corvette Stingray last week, “flimsy” and “unsecured” before painting a contrast with Mar-a-Lago. .“Mar-a-Lago is a highly secured facility, with Security Cameras all over the place, and watched over by staff & our great Secret Service.

The work is called “The Embrace” and it is purportedly taken from a photo of a hug between Martin Luther King, Jr and Coretta Scott King after MLK had won the Nobel Prize. So sweet. But after the unveiling, there were, um, questions. For quite a few observers, those not trapped in the “art-is-whatever-the-artist-says” paradigm, the sculpture was a hot mess, resembling nothing so much as a gigantic act of bronzed cunnilingus. But in an art...<br>ABA Removes LSAT Requirement for Law Schools<br>1/17/2023, 7:19:26 AM · by grundle · 20 replies<br>Fordham Observer ^ | December 13, 2022 | ALFRED GREIG<br>Fordham School of Law’s Office of Admissions will assess whether or not to maintain the test requirement following the decision The American Bar Association (ABA) voted to eliminate the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) as an admissions requirement for law schools across the country on Nov. 18.

But now it applies to another field: higher education. College and graduate degrees were comparatively rare before about 1970. People could be quite successful without them, and there was little stigma attached to their absence. That changed as the baby boomers and the GI Bill hit colleges. By the 1970s, college became an essential ticket to entry in the managerial and professional classes (and even to military promotions). Where higher ed had...<br>Martha Stewart stars in a 'Kill COVID-19' spot for Pfizer<br>1/17/2023, 5:31:20 AM · by DallasBiff · 24 replies<br>Fierce Pharma ^ | 1/13/22 | Sharon Klahr Coey<br>Pfizer’s new COVID-19 booster ad starring Martha Stewart is both rather odd and strangely compelling to watch in a definitive departure from its previous conservative vaccine commercials.
