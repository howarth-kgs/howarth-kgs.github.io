Lok | Feb 17, 2021 | Latest News & Rumors, Movie News | 0  |     <br><br>Gremlins Appear in First Live-Action Material in 31 Years…As Mountain Dew Ad<br>This is the first live-action material that featured Gremlins in 31 years, ever since Gremlins 2: The New Batch in 1990. And as it turns out, it’s a commercial for Mountain Dew. Well, I guess there are worse things to advertise.<br><br><br>Oh, Billy, when are you ever going to learn that feeding Gremlins in general is a Bad Idea?<br>The premise of this Gremlins Mountain Dew ad is pretty simple. Little…well, big Billy Peltzer now (still played by Zach Galligan), is drinking a bottle of Mountain Dew Zero Sugar. It’s exactly what it sounds like, Mountain Dew but made with artificial sweeteners. So of course, when Gizmo begs in an adorable voice for some, Billy thinks that it wouldn’t harm anyone if he gave the little guy some. Probably thought that the zero sugar bit meant that it didn’t count as food. Well, it probably doesn’t, but he forgot what Mountain Dew contains a lot of water.<br><br>So of course, Gizmo splashes some of the Mountain Dew on himself. The little guy quickly starts popping out more gremlins from his back, all the while squeaking “Too tasty!”. Yeah, even Billy’s daughter when she walks in rolls her eyes at him. The gremlin on her shoulder even pulls a Xiao Mei and copies her for added effect. Maybe this time, Billy will learn not to feed the little guy, no matter how adorably he begs for it. Maybe.<br><br>Fullmetal Alchemist scene featuring May Chang and Xiao Mei, doing basically what the gremlin did.<br>Definitely seeing the resemblance here.<br>GREMLINS AD: VERDICT?<br>Gizmo mouthing a Mountain Dew bottle in Gremlins ad.<br>Hard to argue with cuteness.<br>All in all, I actually liked this Gremlins-themed Mountain Dew ad. You know how you sometimes get these commercials that you watch all the way through because they’re so amusing or funny? Well, I would definitely count this ad as one of them. With the humor, the ever-adorable Gizmo, and all the nods to Gremlins fans, this is definitely a very watchable ad. Indeed, I’d put it on the level of the Hotels.com ads featuring Captain Obvious, really.<br><br><br>I know, you didn’t come here just to watch another ad. But this might be worth your time.<br>And really, in the world of ads, there are worse things to advertise than sugar-free Mountain Dew. Much worse.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br>Gremlins just got its first live-action material in 31 years. Unfortunately, it’s an ad for sugar-free Mountain Dew. Fortunately, it’s actually pretty entertaining. Don’t agree? Watch the ad for yourself and decide if you think it’s worth watching.<br><br>Source: JoBlo.com<br><br>FROM THE WEBPowered by ZergNet<br><br>It's Clearly No Secret That Henry Cavill Is A Terrible Dude<br><br>Games Nintendo Needs To Bring To The Switch Immediately<br><br>Game Of Thrones Actor Arrested Over Very Disturbing Allegations<br><br>Superheroes Who Sadly Died In 2019<br><br>Movie Villains Who Are Actually Bombshells In Real Life<br><br>The Freddie Mercury Lyrics That Truly Worried Queen Members<br><br>Malia Obama's Transformation Has Been Turning Heads<br><br>The Tragedy Of Jenna Jameson Just Gets Sadder And Sadder<br>SHARE:<br><br> RATE:12345<br>PREVIOUSCould A Rian Johnson Trilogy Still Be Good For Star Wars?NEXTFuture State: Immortal Wonder Woman 2<br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br>B.K.

The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead and walking in the newness of life. <br>That's what Acts 2:38 is. It harmonizes with Matthew 28:19, and all the other salvation scriptures.  <br>We can't pick and choose which scriptures we like or dislike.  <br>We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOTH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT for a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter the kingdom of GOD.  <br>We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed.  One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans.  <br>Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures, and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.  Eternity is TOO long to be WRONG! St, John 5:39, search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  <br>The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.  <br>It's better to walk alone than with a crowd going in the wrong direction.  Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone.  Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS, and the other is a WORK OF FAITH or OBEDIENCE TO GOD.  <br>If I buy you a cake and tell you to come to get it, and you refuse to, then you won't have the cake even though it's been fully paid for. Christ set up the way, and we must come the way he set up to be saved or to receive it.  <br>Noah believed or had FAITH, BUT THEN WORKED OR OBEYED TO BUILD THE ARK TO BE SAVED. LOT believed or had FAITH, BUT THEN OBEYED AND LEFT SODOM. This is why Jesus said, He that believes and is baptized shall be saved. FAITH EQUALS  OBEDIENCE TO GOD! All scriptures have to harmonize together .<br><br><br><br><br>1Who C's<br>1 year ago<br>I want to make it clear..

Thank you, sir.<br><br>11K<br>468<br><br><br><br>AuAg Finder<br>8 months ago<br>I still like Patton’s speech:  “Your job isn’t to die for your country. Your job is to make the other poor bastard die for his country”<br><br>1.9K<br>60<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>Well one of his first in Italy included also something like don´t take prisoners which acutely caused some war crimes and you would hang our officers which gave such orders. What´s then extra bad is how just the lower ranks which acted on the speech got punished and he is still a war hero.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  how much research have you actually done on this subject? Sounds like you just watched a video and went with it<br><br>13<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  Comes from a actual historian, here are a lot on Youtube. "General George S. Patton, The Biscari Massacre and The Slapping Incidents" <br><br>Kinda almost a funny story how he rather got in trouble later for slapping someone and not just making a speech where he calls for no prisoners and then later wants to cover it up when unarmed prisoner get shoot. <br><br>Like allied war crimes are not really something so rare, my village is even famous for being completely burned down by Canadians as retaliation for a SS crime. Not really something common like on both east fronts where they happen probably each day dozen of times but still there where also some in the west. <br><br>While basically all sides terror bombed civilians to break there moral and well this even seemed to backfire and strengthen moral until the US started to drop nukes. To be fair they also bombed the Chinese whit the pest and probably would have caused such a blood bath if invaded this was probably the way to get the least amount of people killed but i am pretty sure nuking civilians is not legal by international law as well as to fire bomb them to death in the 100.´s of thousands. <br><br>I mean are you Americans kinda unaware you also did commit some war crimes? For example what you called moral bombing is basically the same as our idea to terror bomb civilians which is just by any definition a war crime. Also just because the other side starts ignoring international law mean not your also free to ignore it, the Soviet Union had just left all international agreements but that makes the dozens of millions dead POW´s and civilians not better. <br><br>When you really look into this there seems to be quite a doable standard where US war crimes are somewhere between ignored and justified.<br><br>4<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  George Patton said “dont take prisoners” her didnt say “shoot prisoners”. Their is a difference and that is why Patton didn’t get into trouble for the massacre.<br><br>16<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  Kinda makes it not much better when he told his soldiers to shoot people which lay down there arms which no prisoners means. So they basically got in trouble for doing it not soon enough and accepting surrender. <br><br>While he still tried to cover it up and someone else pushed for an investigation, a German would been executed by the allies for this for sure. <br><br>Also just one of the two guy´s killing prisoners got even convicted, not quite sure what this legal principle is exactly  you call Respondeat superior but sounds kinda like for your soldiers they got to make the defense of just following orders when they did not commit any war crimes on there own but where ordered. Which was just not done for Germans where they are responsible for any criminal act if ordered or not.<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  It war and people die in war. You want to argue semantics then ok. A prisoner is defined as “a person captured and kept in by an enemy, opponent or criminal.” Therefore, if they shot the Germans without capturing them, they don’t fit the legal definition if “prisoner”. Therefore General Patton wasn’t ordering his men to commit war crimes because it wouldn’t have been a war crime.<br><br>11<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  No that´s really not semantics oi argue about, more legal and moral responsibility, you are making it about this. It´s really not a huge difference what he ordered was to not take anybody prisoner which still keep fighting when they got at 200 yards which sounds like the idea was to demoralize the enemy. Meaning when they lay down there arms to late his soldiers where suppose to make an example out of them, pretty clear what he was doing there and i bet you Germans giving similar orders would be charged and pretty likely be justified executed. That´s just an clear war crime, look at this, it´s even worse then i had remembered it. 100% any German you captured and you know about giving such orders would be killed for it. <br><br>"When we land against the enemy, don’t forget to hit him and hit him hard. We will bring the fight home to him. We will show him no mercy. He has killed thousands of your comrades, and he must die. If you company officers in leading your men against the enemy find him shooting at you and, when you get within two hundred yards of him and he wishes to surrender, oh no! That bastard will die! You will kill him. Stick him between the third and fourth ribs. You will tell your men that. They must have the killer instinct. Tell them to stick him. He can do no good then. Stick them in the liver. We will get the name of killers and killers are immortal. When word reaches him that he is being faced by a killer battalion, a killer outfit, he will fight less. Particularly, we must build up that name as killers and you will get that down to your troops in time for the invasion"<br><br>5<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  you are claiming that he told his troops to commit a war crime. You made it about legality, I’m arguing that what he ordered his men to do wasn’t illegal and therefore not a war crime. Now what his men did do was a war crime because they accepted the enemy surrender and killed them afterwards when they were actually prisoners. You can surrender all day long but you aren’t legally a prisoner until you are captured. You aren’t considered captured until the enemy accepts your surrender.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>Missy Victoria<br>8 months ago<br>I like when Gen Geo S Patton said "we have beaten the wrong enemy".. referring to Hitler. Patton was going to come out with the truth about Allies and Communist collaboration to beat Hitler... and he was in a seriously life-threatening automobile "accident." 12 days into his recovery while in the hospital... he was poisoned to death. No doubt, by his own country. "Merica!<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Kyle Rittenhouse's AR-15<br>7 months ago<br> @king oli  <br><br>That's not what happened. Patton ordered that any enemy units that hadn't surrendered by the time American forces got within 200 yards, then any attempted surrender should not be accepted. In those massacres however, the surrender had been accepted and then the prisoners were summarily executed.<br><br>So no, they weren't following Patton's orders. Which is exactly why he was not implicated in those proceedings. But hey, making stuff up is fun!<br><br>5<br><br><br><br>Mike<br>7 months ago<br> @Red_Dawn1984  move the goalposts much?<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>7 months ago<br> @Mike  i never moved any goalposts.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>William Jordan<br>7 months ago<br> @king oli  The United States defends Italy.<br><br><br><br><br>Pierre Laliberte<br>7 months ago<br>Patton, his nickname was 'ol blood 'n guts.

The Geneva convention was agreed to and expected to be followed or you pay the price by jail time up to death if its crimes against humanity. If a platoon surrenders you are not supposed to kil them. You are to give them medical attention and keep them fed and alive until someone wins. Wjats so hard to understand? Youre trying to bring semantics into this. Having prisoners can be useful for bargaining or getting some of your prisoners in exchange. What dont you get?<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Sarah<br>6 months ago<br>It's all stupid. People dying and risking their lives fighting wars for politicians who couldn't care less about them.<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Stan Lee<br>6 months ago<br> @Sarah  not all wars were stupid politicians arguing ... Japan invading us  wasnt about politicians arguing. That was done to weaken us so they could force the trade embargo to be lifted. And to continue pillaging asia unmolested.. And remember Russia was fighting for their very existence as the germans fully intended to kill most of the population and take their land and they few they let live were to be sterilized to prevent any future children and to enslave the few left thay were considered fit to work. Their fight was not stupid and was absolutely necessary.. Now the gulf and Vietnam War was exactly as u said. Politicians sticking their noses in places they had no business.

At the time, he was only 11 years old. Throughout the years of Japan’s occupation of Malaya, my grandpa had shared stories of their cruelty, he and my great grandmother had been beaten ruthlessly by Japanese troops for reasons such as not bowing to an officer or sometimes seemingly for no reason at all. Fearing that my great grandmother would’ve been raped eventually, this had led to him urging my great grandmother into running away and hiding in the jungles. From what he told me, they essentially lived through hell. For 4 years, they were starving and were in constant fear of the Japanese patrols finding them. My great grandmother fell ill from diseases caused by mosquitoes and without medical supplies, she passed away. With her gone, my grandfather was on his own  for another year until news broke out that the Japanese had surrendered due to the atom bombings. It was one of the happiest moments of his life. Furthermore, with years of jungle experience, my grandfather grew up to be a police captain fighting against the communist forces in the jungle during what is now known as the Malayan Communist Insurgency.<br><br>659<br>41<br><br><br><br>Cipher Code<br>7 months ago<br>fishing.

This list contains some of our favorites.<br><br>Definition - "there is truth in wine"<br><br>The classy thing to say when you've had too much to drink and have just said something that is decidedly not classy, in vino veritas has been employed as a mea culpa of sorts for thousands of years. In the first century AD, Pliny the Elder referred to the "common proverb that in wine, there is truth in vino veritas."<br><br>First, Bacchus is mery, Wine moderately taken maketh men ioyfull; he is also naked; for, in vino veritas: drunkards tell all, and sometimes more then all.<br>— Abraham Fraunce, The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch, 1592<br><br>Amor Vincit Omnia<br>couple watching sunset on beach<br>Definition - "love conquers all things"<br><br>Shortly before the start of the first millennium, the Roman poet Virgil wrote "love conquers all things; let us too surrender to Love."<br><br>The phrase and the concept (in Latin and in English) caught on: a character in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, written in the late 1300s, wore a brooch engraved "Amor Vincit Omnia." A number of poets have shown themselves to be fond of working this Latin phrase into their works; amor vincit omnia may be found in the writing of W. H. Auden, John Gower, Diane Wakoski, and many others.<br><br>Amor vincit omnia, so Cato affirmeth, <br>And therefore a Frier whose fancie soone burneth, <br>Because he is mortall and made of mould, <br>He omits what he ought, and doth more than he should.<br>—William Shakespeare, The first and second part of the troublesome raigne of Iohn King of England, 1611<br><br>Carpe Diem<br>family jumping into pool<br>Definition - "enjoy the pleasures of the moment without concern for the future" (literally, "pluck the day")<br><br>During the 1st century BC, the Roman poet Horace wrote, "Seize the day; put no trust in the morrow." The notion of living for the moment crops up over centuries of poetry, including in the writings of Shakespeare, Milton and Byron. Carpe diem, in Latin form, may be found inserted into English prose as far back as the early 18th century.<br><br>Poh, prithee, Gentlemen, ye can't suppose Sir Zealwou'd so blind to his own Insterest, to neglect this Offer,—Hark'e, Knight, take my Advice, close with him at once, Carpe Diem.<br>— Mr. Sandford, The Female Fop: or, The False One Fitted, 1724<br><br>Utile Dulci<br>top 10 latin words to live by utile dulci<br>Definition - "the useful with the agreeable"<br><br>One of our lesser-known Latin expressions, utile dulci shares etymological space with a number of pleasing English words, including addulce ("to mollify"), dulcet ("luscious, melodious"), and the criminally underused dulcitude ("sweetness"). Utile dulci comes from the poet Horace, who in Ars Poetica, offered the following advice:<br><br>"He who joins the useful with the agreeable, wins every vote, by delighting and at the same time instructing the reader."<br><br>Herein is exhibited a connected Plan of Morality, free from that incoherent Jumble so remarkable in many Performances of this Kind. The Utile Dulci having been consulted throughout the Whole, Morality here appears gay and smiling, steals insensibly into our good Graces, and makes the most lasting Impression, being divested of that unpleasing Formality with which she is too often disgusted by partial and Mistaken Pedants.<br>— Jackson's Oxford Journal (Oxford, Eng.), 16 Apr. 1757<br><br>Semper Fidelis<br>top 10 latin words to live by semper fidelis<br>Definition - "always faithful"<br><br>These two words have long served as motto for families, schools, and organizations - most famously, since 1883, for the United States Marine Corps. Semper Fidelis is also the title of the USMC march, composed by John Philip Sousa.<br><br>The result of the election has, however, proved the reflecting portion of the Exonians to be worthy of their motto—Semper fidelis.<br>— The Standard (London, Eng.), 2 May 1831<br><br>Caveat Emptor<br>top 10 latin words to live by caveat emptor<br>Definition - "let the buyer beware"<br><br>In early Roman law, sales of goods were governed by caveat emptor: buyers were advised to scrutinize the goods before purchase, because sellers had few obligations. Over time, the imperative of caveat emptor has been softened by warranties, both express and implied.<br><br>Caveat has been adopted directly into English, and has a small range of meanings, including "a warning enjoining one from certain acts or practices" and "an explanation to prevent misinterpretation." Emptor has likewise been taken directly into our language, although the word is far less common than caveat; it has retained the rather narrow meaning of "buyer, purchaser."<br><br>Where Officers sold their Pay two or three times over, what Provision shall be made for the second or third Purchaser? Caveat Emptor is the common Answer, then let him have a better Bargain for the great Risque he runs, &c.<br>— Anon., The Case of those persons that have purchased soldiers arrears, the Irish transport debt, salt tallies, malt tickets, or an interest in any other deficient funds, 1698<br><br>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc<br>top 10 latin words to live by post hoc ergo propter hoc<br>Definition - "after this, therefore on account of it"<br><br>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc refers to the logical mistake of claiming that one thing caused another just because it happened first.<br><br>For example, the rooster crows and the sun rises - but to argue that the rooster's crowing causes the sun to rise would be post hoc, ergo propter hoc reasoning. It was Aristotle who laid the groundwork for classifying bad arguments based on logical errors like this one.<br><br>Mr. Cobbett's logic is the well known post hoc ergo propter hoc. In the Netherlands, the people eat much less animal food than their Pagan ancestors did two thousand years ago, but it does not follow that the Catholic religion is the cause of the change, any more than the Protestant religion is the cause of the short commons in England.<br>— The Morning Chronicle (London, Eng.), 6 Apr. 1826<br><br>Per Angusta Ad Augusta<br>top 10 latin words to live by per angusta ad augusta<br>Definition - "through difficulties to honors"<br><br>These four words have inspired students and soldiers for centuries. Alternative translations include "through trial to triumph" and "through difficulties to great things."<br><br>It was an obvious fact that right from the very start each one had made up his mind to work hard. The significance of the old motto "Per Angusta ad Augusta," I could not help feeling during the first few weeks after the recruits' entry into camp.<br>— The Digger, 1 Oct. 1918<br><br>Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice<br>top 10 latin words to live by si monumentum requiris circumspice<br>Definition - "if you seek his monument, look around"<br><br>It took 35 years to complete London's magnificent St. Paul's Cathedral. When its architect, Sir Christopher Wren, died twelve years later in 1723, he was entombed inside, under a simple slab of black marble. Wren's son placed a dedication nearby, which contains the words "Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice" ("Reader, if you seek a monument, look around you"). The phrase is generally used to describe a person's legacy - and can be taken to mean that what we leave behind (including intangible things like relationships) best represents our life.<br><br>There are others who have not fared so well in terms of having their name placed in dictionaries in ways that relate to work on old English cathedrals. Sir Edmund Beckett, the first Baron Grimthorpe, is the source of the word grimthorpe ("to remodel an ancient building without proper knowledge or care to retain its original quality and character"), after his attempted restoration of St. Albans cathedral was viewed as subpar.<br><br>Among the authors and printers whose portraits decorated these walls, no portrait of Caxton would be observed, for the simple reason that no authentic portrait had been handed down to us; the well-known momumental inscription to be found elsewhere was, therefore, most appropriate in this place, "Si Monumentum Requiris, circumspice."<br>— The Huddersfield Chronicle and West Yorkshire Advertiser, 2 Jul. 1877<br><br>Aere Perennius<br>line of bronze bells<br>Definition - "more lasting than bronze"<br><br>In the final poem in his third book of Odes, Horace boasts that his poetry will outlive any manmade monument: "Exegi monumentum aere perennius." ("I have made a monument more lasting than bronze.") Given that his words continue to be used two thousand years later, perhaps he's right.<br><br>However I, among others like myself, must submit to their controul; and that my book might wear a better Frontispiece, than a false Title Page and catching Motto, have prefixed a Representation of the Tomb elevated to the memory of the two most enlightened, most able, most liberal, most engaging, and, tout-ensemble, most worthy Monarchs that ever sat on any throne since the deluge; but had they not, as Horace observes, raised a "Monumentum ære perennius" to their memory, and which can never be effaced from the hearts of British subjects, the late tremendous fall of the Abbey might have mouldered their Marble Virtues in the obscurities of eternal night.<br>— Herbert Croft, The Wreck of Westminster Abbey, 1788<br><br>Sic Semper Tyrannis<br>image2140175111<br>Definition - "thus always to tyrants" - motto of Virginia<br><br>Sic semper tyrannis is a phrase with a somewhat problematic history. Some sources have claimed that this was spoken by Brutus as he delivered the knife blow to Julius Caesar. John Wilkes Booth is likewise said to have claimed the same utterance was made when he assassinated Abraham Lincoln. And the words have long been the state motto of Virginia, an incongruity which was much commented upon by abolitionists in the days leading up to the Civil War. But although the words may have been used in conjunction with various acts of violence over the years, this does not mean that they might not be useful; something, perhaps, for you to mutter softly under your breath on the occasion that some despised supervisor is fired from your company.<br><br>The "Sic Semper Tyrannis" of the ever-to-be-execrated Booth, uttered as he rushed from the scene of the great crime of the age conveys no greater insult to the memory of Abraham Lincoln, nor runs no more directly counter to the feelings and sentiments of his countrymen than does this utterance of the late so-called Democratic Convention.<br>— The Bedford Inquirer (Bedford, PA), 29 Sept. 1865<br><br>Veni, Vidi, Vici<br>image1686158374<br>Definition - "I came, I saw, I conquered"<br><br>One of the best known and most frequently quoted Latin expression, veni, vidi, vici may be found hundreds of times throughout the centuries used as an expression of triumph. The words are said to have been used by Caesar as he was enjoying a triumph. By the way, before triumph meant "a notable success" in English it had the meaning of "a ceremony attending the entering of Rome by a general who had won a decisive victory over a foreign enemy." A triumph was better than an ovation, which has the meaning "a ceremony attending the entering of Rome by a general who had won a victory of less importance than that for which a triumph was granted." One would not say "veni, vidi, vici" at an ovation.<br><br>For teaching the use and demonstration of all manner of Geometricall instruments, and the use of all instruments fitting for nauigation, &c. I saie, Quod nemo didicit, nemo docere potest: more peremptorie than Caesar, Veni, vidi, vici.<br>— Ralph Agas, A preparative to platting of landes and tenements for surveigh, 1596<br><br>Share<br> <br>More Words At Play<br>president biden giving speech<br>Biden: 'Tranche' of Sanctions<br>Biden announces Russia sanctions<br><br>fuel gauge indicator<br>The Merriam-Webster Word-O-Meter<br>Some interesting stats from February 2022<br><br>illustrated notebook that says everyday vs every day<br>'Everyday' vs. 'Every Day'<br>A simple trick to keep them separate<br><br>merriam webster time traveler<br>Time Traveler<br>Check out words from the year you were born and more!<br><br> <br>TRENDING NOW<br>tranche<br>Biden announces Russia sanctions<br><br>non assumpsit<br>Canadian truckers drive lookups<br><br>gazpacho<br>Taylor Greene on soup and secret police<br><br>SEE ALL<br>Love words?

Also, actress Sissy Spacic potrayed John boy's girlfriend in The Walton's tv show who was on a couple episodes of the show. First time, as John boy's girlfriend, second time she ran away from Walton's Mountain after she felt spurned by John boy, got pregnant, and John boy delivered her little baby girl after she went into labor.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>@579tweetybird<br>8 months ago<br> @hughdavidvisor1769  Only about 6 months difference in age.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>@henrydiaz720<br>8 months ago<br>Well, alert the media!<br><br><br><br><br>@renzy5270<br>8 months ago<br>The gym teacher<br><br><br><br><br>@KimberlyLetsGo<br>8 months ago<br> @rogerdean5313  I recognized her too!

She had a lead role as the gym teacher in the iconic movie "Carrie" before Eight Is Enough and had already starred on Broadway starting back in the late 60's.  She did countless movies for the big and small screen and became one of Broadways most famous leading ladies of all time including, being called, " The Voice Of Broadway."   She's been nominated for Emmy awards,  Grammy awards and a song she sung for the Movie Tender Mercies which she starred in, was nominated for an Oscar not to mention several Tony nominations and a Tony win for Cats.   Countless albums and world concert tours makes Betty Buckley a pretty big name in the business and rightfully so with her remarkable talent.<br><br><br>Read more<br>3<br>4<br><br><br>Show more replies<br><br>@peterp.194<br>1 year ago<br>I ran into Susan Richardson at a Walmart in Coatesville, PA a couple of years ago.

They had an open set which meant you could walk into the studio and mix with the cast, when the red lights weren't flashing, which meant they were filming..  I had a chance to meet most of them, which was really cool.  Even got to play a short time with Adam Rich when they were doing a thing about saving water in the 1977 drought.
