That’s compared to around after 62% in mid-2020 at the height of pandemic. Locally, D.C. residents said they worked from home 42% of the time, while in Maryland and Virginia workers said they stayed at home about 40% of the time. <br><br>FOX 5 spoke with several DMV residents who said they are happy with having the flexibility to work from home, and believe that the trend will continue. <br><br><br>Worries about when workers will return to work is raising concerns about how downtown business areas will survive in the future. Analysts tell FOX 5 that downtown areas rely on a ripple effect of workers supporting small businesses, like lunch spot and service stores, but with employees not returning to work, those businesses will struggle.<br><br>Assistant White House Press Secretary Emike Simons tells FOX 5 – in addition to inflation - it’s a trend the Biden Administration is watching very closely. <br><br>"The pandemic has changed our lives in innumerable ways, there’s no doubt about it. But what we’re going to do is keep doing our best to keep supporting workers where they are, where they want to be and making sure that they have wages that bring home the bacon," said Simons.

That's less difficult than every driver assumes, as nearly every driver vastly overestimates their driving abilities.<br><br>Regarding blindspots, by definition an AI that does not calculate every possibility will have blindspots. The big question is whether they can be triggered in meaningful ways with meaningful outcomes.<br><br>Facial recognition is currently in that space, as people discover patterns that cause the AI to misclassify a face as not-a-face. There are sweaters with specific patterns that do that, and the effect is rather dramatic. There is make-up that does similar things, but a sweater is easier to apply and take off than make-up. The big downside: the sweaters scream "I'm doing something really strange, as my sweater pattern doesn't match anything that we ever find on any clothing."

To take the chess example: around the turn of the last century, the top chess player at the time, Lasker, picked not just what would be objectively strong moves, but also moves that played into his opponent's weak spots (yes, I know that that assessment of Lasker specifically has been modified recently -without going into a long sidebar of chess history, there are more examples of that available, as well as counter-arguments for Lasker specifically).<br><br>AIs are neither infallible oracles, nor are they mechanical automatons.

Someone who is an expert in a particular area can be blind to unconventional approaches. It's why you have someone proofread who hasn't already read the text multiple times. Or ask someone for feedback who doesnt understand the problem well because their "dumb" questions often expose invalid assumptions or help the experts approach the problem in a better way.<br><br>I mean couldn't an expert human player make this same sort of dumb mistake once? The expectation is not that experts dont make dumb mistakes but rather that they learn from them and dont repeat them. Was the expert AI unable to learn from this defeat?

But if this exploit only works against an AI that has never encounteted it before then I wouldnt see it as a defect on the AI but rather an opportunity improve the data the AI is trained on.<br><br>It's kinda creepy how much AI behavior is an exact analogue for human learning TBH.

Though the point on AI in general is fair game for further consideration.<br><br>If you ask any decently strong human Go player which color they would rather be, if they were to take over as white or black at this point, no one would say they would want to be Black. Objectively, Black here has lost and it would take a considerable skill gap (in Blacks favor) to turn that around (and is likely impossible unless a weak player takes over as white, to make mistakes for Black to exploit).<br><br>The flaw is here “The adversary gets points for its corner territory (devoid of victim stones) whereas the victim [KataGo] does not receive points for its unsecured territory because of the presence of the adversary’s stones.”<br><br>This makes a false assumption that having opponent stones in your territory negates that territories value. Which is false. In the real world both players look at doomed stones in each other's territory and agree that they are "dead". If they disagree, the game can resume or an external judge can come in and decide. Though this only happens if one or both players are very low level.<br><br>You see games like this when there is a large gap of skill. The stronger player gets to a point of complete confidence and starts passing. If the weaker player continues playing, the stronger player will pass or respond as needed to keep the lead. If the weaker player passes, ending the game, the stronger player wins, unless the weaker player cannot be convinced, but if they're that weak they have no ground to stand on.<br><br>If the program at the end is saying Black won, then that program MUST be separate from the program that made White "think" it was winning. Therefore, if there is a flaw it is in a separate, external, system used to determine the winner. Though I highly suspect that the "system" here is a human making a call on false assumptions about the game of Go.<br>Up +54 (+57 / -3) Down<br>1 post | reg.

That's less difficult than every driver assumes, as nearly every driver vastly overestimates their driving abilities.<br><br>Regarding blindspots, by definition an AI that does not calculate every possibility will have blindspots. The big question is whether they can be triggered in meaningful ways with meaningful outcomes.<br><br>Facial recognition is currently in that space, as people discover patterns that cause the AI to misclassify a face as not-a-face. There are sweaters with specific patterns that do that, and the effect is rather dramatic. There is make-up that does similar things, but a sweater is easier to apply and take off than make-up. The big downside: the sweaters scream "I'm doing something really strange, as my sweater pattern doesn't match anything that we ever find on any clothing."

It might take Black up to four moves just to kill one White stone, which is a net losing proposition for Black because each stone Black puts up there decreases his territory score by one, and White can keep doing this.<br><br>To avoid this mess, it's generally understood that a White stone in that corner territory does not mean that Black's territory is now contested unless White manages to put enough stones up there to have a chance at life (or at least a seki), but to know that threshold requires some Go skills.<br><br>I used to be able to easily beat the best Go program in the world, which was at a weak amateur level at the time.

Someone who is an expert in a particular area can be blind to unconventional approaches. It's why you have someone proofread who hasn't already read the text multiple times. Or ask someone for feedback who doesnt understand the problem well because their "dumb" questions often expose invalid assumptions or help the experts approach the problem in a better way.<br><br>I mean couldn't an expert human player make this same sort of dumb mistake once? The expectation is not that experts dont make dumb mistakes but rather that they learn from them and dont repeat them. Was the expert AI unable to learn from this defeat? If so then that is a defect of the AI training models. But if this exploit only works against an AI that has never encounteted it before then I wouldnt see it as a defect on the AI but rather an opportunity improve the data the AI is trained on.<br><br>It's kinda creepy how much AI behavior is an exact analogue for human learning TBH. The days of human intelligence exceptionalism definitely seem numbered. I have no idea how the creation of general AIs that meet or exceed human intelligence will affect society.

Unlike Chess and Go which are turn based with perfect knowledge of the board at all times, SC2 is an RTS with a fog of war feature.

Aug 9, 2017<br>FujiteSmack-Fu Master, in trainingreplyabout 19 hours agoNew PosterReader Fav<br>I must say, while the concept of this piece is intriguing, I feel that this story, if not the original paper, have missed a fundamental aspect of Go as a game. Though the point on AI in general is fair game for further consideration.<br><br>If you ask any decently strong human Go player which color they would rather be, if they were to take over as white or black at this point, no one would say they would want to be Black. Objectively, Black here has lost and it would take a considerable skill gap (in Blacks favor) to turn that around (and is likely impossible unless a weak player takes over as white, to make mistakes for Black to exploit).<br><br>The flaw is here “The adversary gets points for its corner territory (devoid of victim stones) whereas the victim [KataGo] does not receive points for its unsecured territory because of the presence of the adversary’s stones.”<br><br>This makes a false assumption that having opponent stones in your territory negates that territories value. Which is false. In the real world both players look at doomed stones in each other's territory and agree that they are "dead". If they disagree, the game can resume or an external judge can come in and decide. Though this only happens if one or both players are very low level.<br><br>You see games like this when there is a large gap of skill. The stronger player gets to a point of complete confidence and starts passing. If the weaker player continues playing, the stronger player will pass or respond as needed to keep the lead. If the weaker player passes, ending the game, the stronger player wins, unless the weaker player cannot be convinced, but if they're that weak they have no ground to stand on.<br><br>If the program at the end is saying Black won, then that program MUST be separate from the program that made White "think" it was winning. Therefore, if there is a flaw it is in a separate, external, system used to determine the winner. Though I highly suspect that the "system" here is a human making a call on false assumptions about the game of Go.<br>Up +54 (+57 / -3) Down<br>1 post | reg.

The 1-hour 35-minute interview will be available only for the Newslaundry subscribers in an edited version.<br><br><br>Video made private by NewsLaundry. Source: YouTube<br>Notably, Dr Babones’s praises for India and Modi government on several platforms had raised the hackles of ‘liberals’. When Newslaundry uploaded the interview teaser, Dr Babones slammed them for sharing ‘aggressively edited clips’ and challenged them to upload the unedited version, which they did on YouTube. However, it was made private minutes after Babones posted the link on his Twitter page.<br><br>In the interview titled ‘Salvatore Babones on the failings of Indian intellectuals’, Dr Babones accused the co-founder of Newslaundry, Abhinandan Sekhri, of setting up traps and calling him names. Questioning Sekhri’s journalistic approach, Dr Babones called him an “unprofessional interviewer”.<br><br>Interestingly, when Dr Babones challenged Newslaundry to upload a full unedited interview, Sekhri said, “As I told you, all our interviews are uploaded unedited, professor. This one will be no different. These calls for “courage” are childish.” However, the video was gone from NL’s YouTube channel in less than an hour.<br><br>Dr Babones had shared its link on his Twitter account earlier today, but within an hour of his tweet, Newsalaundry turned the video private.<br><br><br>After the video was made private, Dr Babones said, “Hi All. With apologies, Abhinandan has now set my interview to “private”. But if any of you subscribe to Newslaundry, please DM me. You can send me the unlisted link, and I’ll publish it on Twitter every time they update it. Or any other Newslaundry video.”<br><br><br>A Twitter user asked if he had an unedited version of the video, to which Dr Babones said he would not upload it and added, “They [Newslaundry] are. Unedited and in full.”<br><br><br>Furthermore, Babones also shared that his subscription to Newslaundry has ended. “Aww … Newslaundry is sad to see me go! Anyone who is unfortunate enough to have an @Newslaundry subscription, please DM me with some unlisted YouTube video links. Oh, and @AbhinandanSekhr, please do publish the full, UNEDITED Zoom recording of my interview. Thanks and goodnight!” he tweeted.<br><br><br>Dr Salvatore Babones is an Australian socialist who recently created a buzz in India after his videos from India Today conclave went viral. Salvatore had cornered India’s ‘intellectual’ class and said that they were probably losing their place in society. He also lauded India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said, “The personality of Modi is an affront to India’s intellectual class. It has brought them to a new fever pitch of anger over the loss of their place in society”.<br><br>Dr Salvatore had said that India is being wrongly portrayed as a fascist state by the global media, which is affecting its image internationally. He also cornered the left-liberal ecosystem in India who usually keeps on targeting the BJP-led government and called them ‘anti-India.<br><br>“India has problems. And activists, journalists, and intellectuals absolutely have a role to call out the problems. But the problem is that they allow internationally to colour the overall evaluation of this system,” he said. He reiterated that India is not a fascist country and that it is being wrongly portrayed as a fascist state by the global media.<br><br>   Support Us   <br>Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
