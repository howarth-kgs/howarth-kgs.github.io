There’s nothing unclear about this. We aren’t deploying our missiles to the border of the United States, but the United States IS deploying their missiles to the porch of our house. Are we asking too much? We’re just asking that they not deploy their attack-systems to our home…. What is so hard to understand about that?” Russian President Vladimir Putin, YouTube, Start at :48 seconds<br><br><br><br>Imagine if the Mexican army started bombarding American ex-pats living in Mexico with heavy artillery-rounds killing thousands and leaving thousands more wounded. What do you think Joe Biden would do?<br><br>Would he brush it off like a big nothingburger and move on or would he threaten the Mexican government with a military invasion that would obliterate the Mexican Army, level their biggest cities, and send the government running for cover?<br><br>Which of these two options do you think Biden would choose?<br><br>There’s no doubt what Biden would do nor is there any question what the 45 presidents who preceded him would do. No US leader would ever stand by and do nothing while thousands of Americans were savagely slaughtered by a foreign government. That just wouldn’t happen. They’d all respond quickly and forcefully.<br><br>But if that’s true, then why isn’t the same standard applied to Russia? Isn’t the situation in Ukraine nearly identical?<br><br>It is nearly identical, only the situation in Ukraine is worse, much worse. And if we stretch our analogy a bit, you’ll see why:<br><br>Let’s say, the US Intelligence agencies discovered that the Mexican government was not acting alone, but was being directed to kill and maim American ex-pats on orders from the Chinese Communist government in Beijing. Can you imagine that?<br><br>And the reason the Chinese government wants to kill Americans in Mexico is because they want to lure the US into a long and costly war that will “weaken” the US and pave way for its ultimate splintering into many pieces that China can control and exploit. Does any of this sound familiar? (Check out the Rand Strategy for weakening Russia here)<br><br>So, let’s say, the Chinese are actually the driving force behind the war in Mexico. Let’s say, they toppled the Mexican government years earlier and installed their own puppet regime to do their bidding. Then they armed and trained vast numbers of troops to fight the Americans. They supplied these warriors with cutting-edge weapons and technology, logistical support, satellite and communications assistance, tanks, armored vehicles, anti-ship missiles, and state-of-the-art artillery units all of which were provided with one goal in mind; to crush America in a proxy war that was concocted, controlled and micro-managed from the Chinese Capital of Beijing<br><br>Is such a scenario possible?<br><br>It is possible, in fact, this very same scenario is playing out right now in the Ukraine, only the perpetrator of the hostilities is the United States not China, and the target of this malign strategy is Russia not the US. Surprisingly, the Biden administration isn’t even trying to hide what they’re up-to anymore. They’re openly arming, training, funding, and directing Ukrainian troops to prosecute a war aimed at killing Russian soldiers and removing Putin from power. That’s the objective and everyone knows it.<br><br>And the whole campaign is based on the sketchy claim that Russia is guilty of “unprovoked aggression”. That’s the whole deal in a nutshell. The moral justification for the war rests on the unverified assumption that Russia committed a criminal offense and broke international law by invading Ukraine. But, did they?<br><br>Let’s see if that assumption is correct or if it’s just another fake claim by a dissembling media that never stops tweaking the narrative to build the case for war.<br><br>First of all, answer this one question related to the analogy above: If the US deployed troops to Mexico to protect American expats from being bombarded by the Mexican army, would you regard that deployment as an ‘unprovoked aggression’ or a rescue mission?<br><br>Rescue mission, right? Because the primary intention was to save lives not seize the territory of another sovereign country.<br><br>Well, that’s what Putin was doing when he sent his tanks into Ukraine. He was trying stop the killing of civilians living in the Donbas whose only fault was that they were ethnic Russians committed to their own culture and traditions. Is that a crime?<br><br>Take a look at this map.<br><br><br>This map is the key to understanding how the war in Ukraine started. It tells us who did the provoking and who was being provoked. It tells us who was dropping the bombs and who was getting bombed. It tells us who was causing the trouble and who was being blamed for the trouble-making. The map tells us everything we need to know.<br><br>Can you see the yellow dots? Those dots represent the artillery strikes that were documented in daily summaries by “observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE), positioned at the frontlines.” The vast majority of the strikes were in the area inhabited by Russian-speaking people who have been under military siege for the last 8 years. (14,000 ethnic Russians have been killed in the fighting since 2014.) The Minsk Agreements were drawn up to resolve the issues between the warring parties and end the hostilities, but the government in Kiev refused to implement the agreement. In fact, the former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, even admitted that the treaty was just a vehicle for buying time until another full-scale offensive on the Donbas could be launched.<br><br>In short, the Ukrainian government never had any intention of reaching a peaceful settlement with leaders of the Donbas. Their goal was to intensify the conflict in order to provoke Russia and draw them into a protracted war that would exhaust their resources and collapse their economy. The long-range objective was to remove Putin from office and replace him with a Washington-backed stooge that would do as he was told. US officials– including Joe Biden- have even admitted that their plan involved regime change in Moscow. We should take them at their word.<br><br>The map provides a visual account of the events leading up the Russian invasion. It cuts through the lies and identifies the true origins of the war which can be traced back to the heavy artillery strikes launched by the Ukrainian Army more than a week before the Russian invasion. (February 24) The massive shelling was aimed at the Russian-speaking people living in an area in east Ukraine. These are the people who were being bombarded by their fellow Ukrainians.<br><br>What Really Happened?<br><br>On February 16—a full 8 days before the Russian invasion—the shelling of the Donbas increased dramatically and steadily intensified for the next week “to over 2,000 per day on February 22.” As we said, these blasts were logged in daily summaries by observers of the OSCE who were on the frontlines. Think about that for a minute. In other words, these are eyewitness accounts by trained professionals who collected documented evidence of the Ukrainian Army’s massive bombardment of areas inhabited by their own people.<br><br>Would this evidence hold up in a court of law if a case against the Ukrainian government was ever presented before an international tribunal trying to assign accountability for the hostilities?<br><br>We think it would. We think the evidence is rock-solid. In fact, we have not read or heard of even one analyst who has challenged this vast catalogue of documented evidence. Instead, the media simply pretends the proof doesn’t exist. They have simply swept the evidence under the rug or vanished it from their coverage altogether in order to shape a Washington-centric version of events that completely ignores the historical record. But facts are facts. And the facts don’t change because the media fails to report them. And what the facts suggest is that the war in Ukraine is a Washington-concocted war no different than Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya or Syria. Once again, Uncle Sam’s bloody fingerprints are all over this sorry affair.<br><br>Check out this summary of ceasefire violations posted on podcast host Martyr Made’s twitter account:<br><br>Martyr Made @martyrmade<br><br>On Feb 15, the OSCE recorded 41 ceasefire violations as Kiev’s forces began shelling Donbas.<br>Feb 16: 76 violations<br>Feb 17: 316<br>Feb 18: 654<br>Feb 19: 1,413<br>Feb 20-21: 2,026<br>Feb 22: 1,484<br>…virtually all by the Kiev side. Feb 24: Russian forces intervene<br><br>Notice how the shelling of the Donbas increased every day before the invasion?<br><br>I’d call that a thoroughly-calculated provocation, wouldn’t you?<br><br>Why does this matter?<br><br>It matters because the vast majority of people have been hoodwinked into supporting a war for which there is no moral justification. This is not a case of “unprovoked aggression”. Not even close. And Putin is not an out-of-control tyrant bent on reconstituting the Soviet Empire by terrorizing his neighbors and seizing their territory. That is a complete fabrication based on nothing but speculation. In Putin’s own words, he invaded Ukraine because he had no choice. His own people were being ruthlessly exterminated by an army that acts on Washington’s orders alone. He had to invade, there was no other option. Putin felt a moral obligation to defend the ethnic Russians in Ukraine who could not defend themselves. Is that aggression? Here’s a bit more background from an article at The Intercept by James Risen:<br><br>Despite staging a massive military buildup on his country’s border with Ukraine for nearly a year, Russian President Vladimir Putin did not make a final decision to invade until just before he launched the attack in February, according to senior current and former U.S. intelligence officials.<br><br>In December, the CIA issued classified reports concluding that Putin hadn’t yet committed to an invasion, according to the current and former officials. In January, even as the Russian military was starting to take the logistical steps necessary to move its troops into Ukraine, U.S. intelligence again issued classified reporting maintaining that Putin had still not resolved to actually launch an attack, the officials said.<br><br>It wasn’t until February that the agency and the rest of the U.S. intelligence community became convinced that Putin would invade, the senior official added. With few other options available at the last minute to try to stop Putin, President Joe Biden took the unusual step of making the intelligence public, in what amounted to a form of information warfare against the Russian leader. He also warned that Putin was planning to try to fabricate a pretext for invasion, including by making false claims that Ukrainian forces had attacked civilians in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists. The preemptive use of intelligence by Biden revealed “a new understanding … that the information space may be among the most consequential terrain Putin is contesting,” observed Jessica Brandt of the Brookings Institution.”<br><br>Biden’s warning on February 18 that the invasion would happen within the week turned out to be accurate. In the early hours of February 24, Russian troops moved south into Ukraine from Belarus and across Russia’s borders into Kharkiv, the Donbas region, and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.” (“U.S. Intelligence Says Putin Made a Last-Minute Decision to Invade Ukraine”, James Risen, The Intercept)<br><br>There’s so much baloney in this excerpt, it’s hard to know where to begin. But just review the timeline we provided earlier; a timeline that has been verified by officials from the OSCE. Can you see the discrepancy?<br><br>Biden issued his warning on February 18; that’s two days after monitors from the OSCE reported an intensification of the bombing in the Donbas. In other words, Biden already knew that his buddies in the Ukrainian army were bombing the shit out of east Ukraine when he tried to make it look like he was privy to some sensitive, insider information about the upcoming invasion.<br><br>Of course, he knew Putin was going to invade! They created the provocation that forced him to invade! They were bombing the hell out of the people Putin is obliged to protect. What else could he do? Any leader worth his salt would have done same thing.<br><br>What bothers me is that people continue support the war in Ukraine because they have no idea of what actually happened in the lead-up to the invasion. They know nothing about the relentless bombing of civilians, or the defiant rejection of Minsk or the repeated military attacks on the Donbas, or the or the plan to retake Crimea through force of arms. or the laws directed against ethnic Russians, or the rise of Nazi fascism in Kiev. They know nothing about any of these things. Their views on Ukraine are entirely shaped by the rubbish they read in the western media or hear on the cable news channels where the deluge of propaganda issues like a mighty river pulling the population inexorably towards another vicious neocon bloodbath.<br><br>People must know the truth or this war will escalate into something far worse.<br><br>← Meet the New Boss; Putin Reroutes Criti...  <br>Subscribe to New Columns<br>Tweet<br>Reddit<br>1<br>Share<br>Share<br>22<br>Email<br>Print<br>More<br>23 SHARES<br> <br>• Category: Foreign Policy • Tags: American Media, American Military, NATO, Russia, Ukraine <br>← Meet the New Boss; Putin Reroutes Criti...  <br>Hide 215 CommentsLeave a Comment<br>"Some of Us Don't Think the Russian Invasion Was "Aggression."

The increased German purchase of Russian gas would both strengthen the bond between Germany and Russia and strengthen the German economy, with increased independance from US ruled energy sources, like LNG from the US, for which unloading point were already being built in France, Poland and the Netherlands. Furthermore, due to the efficient energy grids in Europe (electrical power plants and gas distribution hubs are coupled across EU nations), other EU countries would also enjoy benefit from cheap Russian gas, lowering the overall prices and effecting the future market rates, which provides handsome profits for Brussels and also the Dutch government (through TTF). And lastly, there were wishes in many nations outside the US, to get rid of the petro-Dollar and arrange payments in Euros, Rubles, Renminbi, Rupees or Riad.

This is a dangerous mix. On top of that, it’s apparently become our new national mission to export ‘freedom and democracy’ whenever the geniuses in Zio-Washington declare it necessary. Unfortunately, sometimes this mission requires the use of precision guided missiles. USA! USA!<br><br>Add to that, a good deal of mainstream American news involves big stories about ‘sport heroes’, socialites and fashionistas, killing dictators for the good of humanity, the latest blockbuster film, or a very important story about one of the Kardashians. This is where we are. Cultural junk food is what’s for dinner. Low nutrition. Low information. Low morality.<br><br>In a similar vain, most adult Americans react to headlines in predictable fashion. Few think broadly and critically about the ingredients (or architects) of mass-produced ‘news’. But Headlines–like the news itself–are manufactured, choreographed, and staged. Each and every day. The custodians of political culture manage public opinion this way.<br><br>Thus, while empty allegations about ‘Russian collusion’ during Trump’s era were highlighted continuously, genuine evidence about the tangible contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop were cancelled or denied. This was no accident. It tells us who is in charge–and who is likely being targeted. What’s worse, this non-elected political power never leaves town. Unlike an unpopular candidate, it endures.<br><br>Those who manage America’s news diet also realize that they can create anxiety and panic where there should be nothing more than curiosity (the dubious theory of catastrophic, anthropogenic ‘climate change’, for instance, fits this mold) or create apathy and acceptance where there is genuine danger, as with the Zio-America’s unnecessary escalation of military violence directed towards Putin’s Russia. This is just one expression of the raw and dangerous power that comes from a unified, militant, and ruthless cabal of media conglomerates.<br><br>Keep in mind that Russia remains a beleaguered ally of both Syria and Iran. This alliance explains a lot about the motives behind Zio-America’s mission to ‘rescue’ Zelensky’s Ukraine from ‘outside aggression’.

With all the ways we all have for delivering nuclear warheads, we all have missiles on our immediate borders so to say Putin was reacting to NATO’s encroachment is disingenuous.<br><br>The main framework of what has happened is clear. Putin stated up front his justification was to restore the Russian empire to its former glory, and even that explanation was contrived with heavy distortion of fact.

Unfortunately for Russia, Putin overestimated his military’s capabilities and underestimated Ukrainian resistance. Further, it didn’t help that his massing of forces and details of his plans were well known in advance, giving Ukraine and its allies time to prepare. His blitzkrieg was an embarrassing cluster and it seems that every subsequent decision and application of assets have been poorly made. Not only did Putin not take Kiev, but his forces are being driven out of areas he tacitly controlled prior to the invasion and Crimea seems to be up for grabs. His command staff is in disarray and his troops lack the support and will to fight. Open dissent has appeared throughout Russia and men at risk of being impressed into service are fleeing Russia as fast as they can. The lid Putin was trying to keep on how badly the war was going has been lifted. That’s not to say that there are not ardent Putin supporters but people can only make good decisions when they have all of the information.<br><br>Sun Tsu wrote – If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

This is the end-result of American “foreign policy.” We’ve been Poking the Bear since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. We had the (actually stated!) opportunity back then to be “one, big, happy family” in the West, along with Russia. The Soviets had completely thrown in the towel, and a New Era could have begun right then and there. To his credit, Bush Senior actually lived up to his agreement with Gorbachev and Yeltsin to not move NATO “one inch east” toward Russia, but this.changed, beginning with Clinton and continuing down to the present day. NATO should have been abandoned by the mid-1990s, when it was clear that the Russians were not going to revert to Soviet-style politics, economics and philosophy. Their Warsaw Pact alliance had already dissolved; we should have reciprocated with a dissolution of NATO, whose only valid purpose for existence was to protect western Europe from Soviet invasion. This was never going to happen, ergo, NATO was suddenly unnecessary. Unfortunately, that reality was ignored.<br><br>But it wasn’t just ignored! The alliance was expanded. The NATO alliance in place in the mid-90s actually grew in its membership, and Russia was progressively encircled with a closer and closer radius, with seven former Warsaw Pact countries entering between 1999 and 2004. This culminated with NATO even *touching* the border of Russia directly in the form of Estonia and Latvia becoming NATO members in 2004. NATO memberships have continued along even since then, with Montenegro added in 2017 and North Macedonia added in 2020. Sweden, and Finland (ALSO bordering Russia directly on an 800 mile line!) are about to become members. And, of course, it has been loudly “discussed,” since 2008 at the Bucharest NATO summit, that Ukraine (also, obviously, *bordering Russia directly*), should eventually be added. The Russians have “duly noted” ALL of this, you can be sure!<br><br>Look at a freaking map, people! The Russians are completely encircled to the northwest, west, and southwest, from Finland through Turkey, with two countries directly on Russia’s border in the northwest, and six more countries: Lithuania, Poland Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and North Macedonia, all with just one buffer country (Belarus – a Russian ally – and Ukraine itself) between them and Russia. The West has become increasingly bellicose in its rhetoric all through the 21st Century, sanctioning the Russians over and over again with increasing severity for…what, exactly? Their continued objections to this constant menacing behavior from the US and the NATO alliance? Someone please point out exactly what the Russians have done to Europe since 1991 that would merit our behavior towards them.

As such, Uke ethno-fascism makes no sense, … as such, it it clear that instead it’s a Russian canard sown to produce discord<br><br>– somebody has got in the middle of the brotherhood, and that somebody is a man named Putin, the evilest of all the evils, …. a most despicable awful man, … and he has done this by lying and fingering the Kiev regime as supportive of Uke ethno-fascism. But that is a canard. Because the grassroots Russian and Uke peoples are actually Slavic brothers, who love and appreciate one another.<br><br>– The Russian leaderships have misbehaved before. There was a replacement of Russian people, for the Uke people that were exterminated during the Holodomor, within regions of the Ukraine (I don’t think this point is at all accurate, though …. i.e. – Russians outside of Ukraine starved to death as well). The Putin regime is in the midst of repeating this kind of Russian-style glory, at the expense of dead Ukes (or relocated Ukes), but yet again. But this is not due to grassroots animosity between the Slavic brothers, Ukes and Russians – it is because of crazy crazy Russian (or Georgian) dictators like Stalin or Putin.<br><br>– As such, the patriotic thing to do, as a 2nd or 3rd generation Canadian Uke, is to rally worldwide Ukedom (and other sympathetic parties) to come over and kill the Russian invaders, inclusive of the Russians in Ukraine that are sympathetic to the Russian invaders.<br><br>This rationale is pretzel shaped (circularly contradictory). It amounts to this:<br><br>‘Kill Russians to save the true grassroots Russian/Uke common Slav-ship, because Putin-man-bad.’<br><br>This way, my 2nd and 3rd generation Uke friends can pretend they are not ethno-fascists, when indeed they are, and indeed they are fully supportive of any western action or provocation in this vein. In other words, my 2nd and 3rd generation Canadian Uke friends project their own ugly ethno-fascist tendencies onto a caricature of Putin.<br><br>Look, I’m in my early 60’s and I have had these friends my whole life since elementary school. Whilst growing up, I knew there was some resentments between Ukes, Poles, and Russians within some Canadian families, ….. but many of these families were of of mixed Uke/Polish heritage with overtones of distant Russian family relations, as well. Back at that time, I more or less thought of it as similar to the dynamic of the Irish ‘troubles’, …. that since they are practically brothers, they will find a way to work it out. I’m not so sure of that now. My Uke Canadian friends (all bright people, in their own right) otherwise seem to be idiots, and most willing to choose that idiot-ship, when there is an opportunity to get some ethno-fascist good-feelz, by way of practicing said idiot-ship. How does one go about undoing that? It’s almost schizophrenic. But it is not that these people are schizophrenic (i.e. – otherwise completely normal), but instead, it is that the Jewish-controlled mainstream media they consume is schizophrenic.<br><br>The sentiment of my Canadian Uke friends is being used by the Trudeau regime, to involve Canada in this awful escalation of the Ukraine war. And I don’t like that one bit, because it is wrong. As far as I can tell, if Canada’s escalation continues to get worse, I am then within my rights, to tell my Canadian Uke buddies to f*ck-off with their puerile good feelz around the potential of winning narrowly, at the expense of others losing (win/lose mindset instead of win/win mindset). I am sorry, but as a patriotic Canadian, my concern over world war 3 escalation, trumps their need for some stupid ‘ethno-fascism parading as brotherly love’, by about 1,000x. I am right and they are wrong. If they don’t soon get with the program, I am probably gonna go scorched earth on their continuing idiocy. Shouldn’t they know more about this Ukraine country they claim so much love and support for, since said support is so emotional for them, as compared to a non-Ukes like myself?

Russia and China are working on a new reserve currency that includes gold and once that hits, any nation without the gold to compete will lose out big time. The eastern nations are also dumping US paper as fast as they can, meaning there aren’t buyer for new US paper.

There needs to be pushback against the obnoxious myth of Gallant Ukraine, along with schmaltzy internet postcards on FB and other media. Most of the other posters on this and other sites simply prefer a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement. This means that Ukraine can kiss the Crimea and the Donbass goodbye, but them’s the breaks; embark on deadly gambits, pay a deadly price, win no prizes. What angers me is not just the myth but the attempt to suppress differing opinions and to demonize those who have the effrontery to publicly express them. Much more tragic is the fact that patriotic Ukrainians are risking and often losing their lives in the service of globalism. The memesters in Kiev and their media flunkies in Lvov have deluded the West into the belief that a “counterattack” against screening and rearguard forces is a harbinger of ultimate victory (by Christmas, no doubt) against the Russian hordes. Nope, the Russians seem to be solidifying their hold on the Donbass provinces. The airborne coup de main near Kiev notwithstanding (failing to prevent the Zielinskys Vogue shoot) I doubt whether the Russians intend to advance far beyond their current positions, since the Poles may be more actively drawn in if the Russian regulars encircle Odessa and head for the Dniester Valley, where they have a battalion or so of “peacekeepers” in a disputed part of Moldova known as Transnistria.

Hand-wringers. Copers. Enablers. Tongue cluckers.”<br><br>Well, that is a question that is very deep and very difficult to answer. But I will try my best.<br><br>If the Jews, with their long troublesome history having failed to teach them humility and goodwill towards other fellow humans, then any rational person should doubt that they will ever change . As to whether their sins are the consequence of their Rabbinical teachings or are innate to their very nature, is an open question that is beyond me to delve upon in a scholarly way.<br><br>Throughout Jewish history, there has been Jewish apostates like Pfeferkorn, Benjamin Friedman, Brothern Nathaniel Kapner and many others but the most famous of them was Saul of Tarsus. Those people managed to turn their messianic drive against the authority of the rabbis, but did not make a big enough dent in the mainstream narrative about Jewishness. But we should not forget that what we refer today to as Palestinians, were some of the first converts from the Hebrew tribes to Christianity and later to Islam. It is the powerful core Hebrew establishment of Judea that denied and crucified Christ who have proven to be astute survivors driven by fanatical anti Christianity, and they evolved into Sabbatean Frankism which is a far more destructive version of Judaism than any other the world has ever known.<br><br>So what options are left for mankind with respect to the current highly destructive ideology of rabbinic Judaism which has been exposed by many great writers like Douglas Reed, Michael Hoffman, E. Michael Jones and others. The choice should emanate from the conscience of every capable leader who has the proper understanding and the moral courage to tackle the issue of nonstop destructive Talmudic messianism. While I am not a believer in the Holocaust, I do subscribe to the ideas of one of Judaism’s involuntary enablers, Martin Luther, when after having exhausted his options to bring the Jews to reason, declared his solution of total boycott of any relationship with them in his book “On The Jews and Their Lies”. The first step into the path of boycott should be to stop listening to the mainstream media, stop watching Hollywood and stop trading the stock market or accepting interest income.<br><br>Putin’s battle, which he tried for many years to avoid, should be a make or break event for humankind to put once and for all Jewish messianism back in the Pandora box. Putin’s failure would signal the death of human dignity in a world of ultimate slavery. A ray of hope to the brave and the good of the world would materialize when we see the likes of Klaus Schwab and George Soros and their handlers facing a war crime tribunal.<br><br>REPLYAGREE/DISAGREE/ETC.

Going for shock and awe would have put the Talmudic controlled media into overdrive labelling him the New Hitler and getting Russia under trade sanctions. On the other hand, suing for a peaceful solution would have put Russian security one step closer to the abyss judging by everything that happened since the fall of the Soviet Union.<br><br>The choice for those of us standing by the sidelines is much easier than it is for the leader who has take fateful decisions for his people. What military warfare in the previous century and this one has proven was that aerial warfare will never give victory without boots on the ground. Despite the immense damage done to Serbia by NATO, the Serbian army hardly lost its capacity to act like a formidable fighting force. Israeli extensive air assaults on Lebanon in 2006 did not win them the battle against the far smaller militia of Hizbollah. Besides, shock and awe would not have prevented massive retaliation against the Donbas by the the more than seventy thousand Ukrainian troops that had already amassed to strike the Russian speaking enclaves.<br><br>But then, if Russia had gone for a shock and awe operation, how would Russia be any different from the Anglo Zionist Empire which always proclaims a Rules Based Order as opposed to what Mr. Legality Putin has been pushing for as International Law based order.<br><br>Putin’s gamble to win the right of cessation of the Russian Oblasts with minimal damage has clearly failed. I have no doubt that he had considered such an outcome and the massive bombing of Kyiv is the first sign of Russia renouncing a civilized approach to winning wars. After all, what is to be expected of a puppet like Zelensky who was advocating a couple of days ago that the Western Alliance should nuke Russia as a deterrent to having Russia use her nukes.
