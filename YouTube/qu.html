The survey, comprising 16 nations and 16,254 adult internet users, found that seven out of 10 in India encountered tech support scams in the past year.<br><br>Basically India has the cheapest English-speaking labor of any country with a government and law enforcement that are too slow to react to illegal practices to prevent them.<br><br>India has a population of 1.3B+ , 15℅ of the world's population. A lot of them are unemployed and struggling with poverty. They are bought into this scamming business on the virtue of commission. Also, our beloved neighbors Bangladesh and Pakistan are also equally involved in this scamming business but since all our accents are more or less similar, they also pass off as Indian scammers.<br><br><br>I do want these things to stop. It sounds really pathetic that people are making a business out of scamming old people or people who are not that familiar with internet. Anyway, karma is there to take care of them.<br><br>I am also a big fan of a YouTube channel called Scammer Payback. I love how he scams the scammers themselves.<br><br>Take care everyone :)<br><br>Not just Indian but other cultures as well such as Nigerians. To them its a lucrative way to make a living.<br><br>I get targeted so often through Facebook and Instragram. Telling them you are older, happily married and have kids has no affect on them. They still pursue you like a love sick puppy.<br><br>I have strung a few alomg to see what happens. They get quite agressive demanding to know where you are, are you at home now, where do you live etc.<br><br>Once you know what to look for they are easily spotted and dealth with.<br><br>I’ve also had three scam emails answering two car adverts i listed online recently. Not sure if they are Indian as such but i did speak to one on the phone and he was definitely middle eastern of some decent.<br><br>Can I hack a scammer?<br>Hacking scammers, it is simple!<br><br>I’ve done it many times, or worse let them infect their own computers, they seem to just disappear offline! ☺<br><br>Many scammers have no idea of where they target. Spammers are better, it’s simple to put some malware together so you get all their info, and hack their webcams, but disable the webcam LED. They have no idea they are infected, because their own computers never have their antivirus updated.<br><br>Normally, you see a group of about 12 people in a room on really old computers, they have no idea about security, which is why it is so easy to take them out.<br><br>There’s a co<br><br>Why are there so many tech support scammers in India?<br>Because the Indian police refuse to do anything about it.<br><br>You can literally say here the scammer is called XXXX and works at YYYYY and they will do absolutely nothing about it. They have a “cyber police” department, but they don’t bother to lift a finger to investigate.<br><br>I see a lot of answers from Indians with their whataboutism about how scammers exist everywhere, or how look at company XYZ scams you from USA… yes .. but India is number one at scamming.<br><br>Why ? Greed.<br><br>It’s not muh bollywood and people wanting better life, I mean we have hollywood too and there are a lot more rich folk in USA than in India but the number of Indian scammers is huge and the major reason why ? Zero repercussions. They’re not going to jail .. because India tacitly approves of this sort of stuff.<br><br>Prove me wrong.<br><br>I recently became aware that there is no conept in the Indian culture equivalent to concept represented by the word Lie. So in other words, they say whatever is necessary to accomplish the task at hand. Its not a lie of you dont know what the concept of a lie is. This explains a lot, and its sad to say that I have worked with indians directly.<br><br>I would like to go firmly against your statement that the only reason Indians scam is due to greed.<br><br>Because there are so many people in India, just having a diploma/degree does not guarantee a job. There is extreme jb competition present, families become helpless and people even go to the level of suicide due to the lack of a career.<br><br>So people turn to sneaky ways to earn their living. Even off other people’s lives. Initially, they surely feel wrong about scamming the vulnerable of their life savings, but over time they just get used to it and the feeling of guilt evaporates.<br><br>I agree that scamming is incorrect and that the government is not very strict in its efforts to scam crackdown, but greed is not the only reason that drives people to wrong ways.<br><br>If you don’t have money, commit suicide like a gentleman and don’t scam others. Besides, who told you to fuck without a condom to then realize that children cost money? Nobody, it was your choice. Therefore doing harm to scammers in india is your moral duty if you are a hacker. Aswell as hacking the indian government to blackmail them into taking action.<br><br>that's precisely what a high American cult leader would say right there<br><br>your opinion is as clouded as your level of understanding<br><br>let me tell you attacking wrongdoers is not the way to deal with criminals or government people, you’ve got to bring about awareness and helpful strategies. think about that for a second, any fool could run around shouting that all Indian scammers and government authorities are bound to hell. it takes more effort to actually bring about a positive change.<br><br>radically opposing the scamming industry might give a short term reduction, but they will reoccur and bounce back, with stronger tactics and bigger goals. they might even plan on taking their revenge on all those non-progressive shitholes who ruined their business.<br><br>Or perhaps you reject victims because you reject any part of yourself you deem as weak, thus always try to be strong, thus always find the good in everything. The part of you that cannot blame a person who harms others might need you to understand something.<br><br>There are those who commit suicide, suffer from anxiety, depression, constant sorrow caused from misdirected guilt and shame.<br><br>These people have a low self-esteem and don’t know how to feel worthy.<br><br>And there are those who rob, scam, steal, abuse, reject, deny, manipulate, ridicule, stalk, bully, torment, intimidate, lie and worse.<br><br>These types never feel guilt and they are often enabled by the former type.<br><br>Maybe I am off base but one day you may feel thankful there are people willing to punish and put evil where it belongs.<br><br>Let’s just hope for your sake that day doesn’t come with you as one of their victims, having had to learn the hard way!<br><br>I get the whole unconditional loving, empathetic, evolved higher perspective.<br><br>We must all find balance.<br><br>arent empathy, love and forgiveness what enabled us, humans, to develop into the social beings we are today?<br><br>a world where mercy and a chance to improve and correct oneself exists is the only type where actual progress may ever be seen.<br><br>it is not just in this part of the world, too…. can you, with a clear conscience, claim that fair treatment or second chances were never provided to you in your life? and that it was for the best? where would we all have been, if we were put to death or worse, for wrong deeds we commit? would civilization ever exist the way it is now?<br><br>Both of you are right with your point. I’m just gonna add my point. My point is, there are some ppl are too lost to become good again. They have no morality, no heart or soul. Is it fair to us to give them the same treatment? No. Those people belongs where they should belong. Reality is, you gotta pay for your consequences, you can’t just scam people and get away with it. If no one willing to pay, there will me more people becoming that because they thought they can get away with it, why not do it. Some people are just too lost to even realize that they need to become better. Tell me I’m wrong but in reality, I know there are people have no moral at all, socialpath, psychopath. Bottom line is, when you commit a crime, dangerous to others, it’s only right that you need to be faced with justice. Because morality and justice are the things that keep us human remain humane and be righteous.<br><br>I get the whole empathy and second chance thing. But in order to give people that might capable of changing for the better, we need to put evil at bay and use justice to show people what’s right and what’s wrong. And only those people who willing to change and regret of their actions, they will receive the community love, support and empathy. But other than that, they can’t just tell us to keep give them a chance, to not charge them, give them empathy and sympathy, but they still commit crimes, still scam people. How many more chance do we have to give those people like that? How much love and empathy do we have to give people like that so that one day hoping they can change? No, it doesn’t work like that. And that’s how justice comes into play. That’s why we need people who work for the law or government to help us stopping this.<br><br>In the eye of Gods, that’s a sin. But if you willing to change, ask for forgiveness and really put it into action and not just all talk. Then you earn the right to receive second chance and sympathy. Because those things that you said, need to be earned. Second chance, sympathy, empathy and support. Because I will never support, or sympathize to those won’t change, period.<br><br>We’re talking from the standpoint of morality. But there are those who don’t and we try to correct them and make them think the same way we do. Besides, morality and values comes from us. Why, then, does it matter if scammers, who are humans, scam if we think objectively? We reason that it helps other people, but how about the scammers? If the scammers do not align with our moral code, we stop treating them as humans. But let’s switch this around. What if, in a world with scammers, a person with a moral code similar to ours preaches their standards? The scammers would stop treating THEM as humans. They are also the normals of that world. This discrepancy of societal standards is why I hate morals. I feel indifferent to scammers and victims cause I understand why the both of them would do it. Even if the scammer is being an asshole, it’s the product of their brain similar to how being nice is the product of our brain. We may argue that empathy and such is essential to life but life has no true purpose. It is insignificant to the greater world out there, so why does morality matter? If we think about it, it only benefits those who have a similar set of morals. Anyways, I apologize for ranting. Just had to get my reply out there.<br><br>bingo there, since its such a lawless place I figure we could just send the military over and deal with them. And USA should if they care that much about money, hey guys EAST INDIANS are stealing it from you and YOU do nothing. I’m Canadian, and no we’re not all anti violence.<br><br>For one, DROP A 500 pound bomb on… ONE call center, proceed to watch the pure panick and unwillingness for ANY one else die’ing just to scam people. Hey call it inhumane… BUT IT WOULD WORK.<br><br>Try it.<br><br>I don't think that's true from a percentage stand point. India has more number of scammers because the population is large. Hence India has huge number of doctors, engineers and lawyers. Percentage of people involved in these activities would be really low if you look at it from a percentage of entire population.<br><br>Yeah, but still India has most number of scammers. And that's affecting the world. You don't say from a percentage standpoint, Jamaica has earned more gold medals in the Olympics than America, do you? We need to accept that our country has a lot of scum that needs to be cleaned.<br><br>You are right. Police does not do anything.<br><br>This is the correct answer. The Indian culture doesn't have anything that prohibits you from stealing from others , as long as you don't steal from your own its fine. And Indians always see foreigners as others and people to exploit<br><br>Its not about “India promoting this sort of stuff"….The law and order in India in general is screwed up. This isn't a specefic case in which there is no action taken…almost everything is like this.<br><br>Linenecy of cops. They don't act like they r cops. They are themselves corrupted.<br><br>Amazing… Every word of what you just said was right<br><br>I agree man. I am an Indian, but i dont want to call myself as an Indian because of many scammers. the thing is that people from the early age of High School start developing the desire for money because their parents don’t do shit. So the real culprits are : 99.99% of the Indian Parents. Greed is the most in India compared to any other country, and the reason : Indian parents not providing their kids with efficient basic resources. Now almost every parent in India (including my parents ) act like “ If you don’t get good grades, I won’t provide you with food for the entire day tomorrow “. Now If Indian Parents stop acting this harsh towards their kid and remove the “ need to be perfect student “ logic, this kinda stuff would go down rapidly. Now I won’t say that it will be eradicated completely, because there are a few idiotic brain dead un-fit to live kids in our country, who will do anything for money. But the real cause of the problem are Parents.<br><br>Damn, so the Indian Government is to blame? Bruh, no wonder there’s so many compared to other nations.<br><br>Partly yes. But, there are sincere police. These people evade coz the contacts they have in the law enforcement warn them first hand. If they get caught, they'll go to jail.<br><br>Scammers are not going to jail in india because there are no victims in india except outside country. Plus the American government doesn't give a big fat damn<br><br>Wrong, there are victims in India too.<br><br>Yup. These scam callers keep calling me for no reason everyday.<br><br>lol.<br><br>You could say the same thing for crypto soyboys in my inbox. There's such an influx of them it's ridiculous.<br><br>Why are so many phone scam call centers located in India?<br>Scam call centers always existed in India. However, after 2017 situation changed drastically. India saw a record number of unemployment. And millions of newly graduated youths needed jobs to start their lives. This is then when things got out of hands. These youths knew better English. They were technically sound but there were no jobs for them in India. So, the number of scam call centers grew dramatically.<br><br>Nowadays, scam call centers recruit not just freshly graduated people but also undergraduate students. In many cases, scammers are doing courses in IT. Indian Government is aware of this si<br><br>How can scammers, like those that call with an Indian accent and claim to be from Microsoft Tech support or the IRS, live with themselves?<br>I actually had a long conversation with one of these scammers while pretending to go along with his scam. After making small talk I then asked him if he believed in God, he said “Of Course I do” so I asked him “How can you live with yourself doing these scams? Do you think Our Creator will accept this?” He got emotional and said that this was how he supports his family. I gave him some advice on how to find a legal means of making money.<br><br>I personally feel that the United Nations should hold India accountable for this. Considering that these Call Centers are a Major Source of Income in India their Government is fully aware of these Illegal Activities but since they're making Tons of Money from it they do not shut them down.<br><br>How I can post my experience with a scammer?<br>You better don't get outed as a victim.<br><br>What do you think, that here, like on all social media, are no scammers ready to attack you to milk you out (jargon), you better avoid that and search for professional treatments for psychological support. Anyway I answer for my mother, but your question sounds more than strange. 🎶<br><br>All of these phone scammers with Indian-like accents. What country are they calling from?<br>They could be from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or Philippines. They use fake accent. Some of them are located here. Don’t share any personal information with them. Tell them to leave their phone number and you will get back to them. You can check their veracity with the agency which claim to be representing.<br><br>Can I track a scammer?<br>Scammers mostly think they can hide from the law enforcement agencies. The update in the tracking technology developed by law enforcement agencies can fish out the scammers location and also track payments to see where it has been redirected.

Find Brian Anfield’s quora profile and blog<br><br>Do scammers use internet Hangout site?<br>It’s one of their favorite app to use. Their aim is to get victims on dating sites or instagram then tell them to chat them up on hangout because they can’t be reported unlike other apps like instagram, facebook and dating sites where they and reported and blocked.

Because nobody likes to admit that they did something stupid even though it may be a case of miss placed trust with a side of stupid. And our society is only too happy to let you know how smart they are and how stupid you are.

Why do women nag generally — is it biological or sociological?<br>You will not get an honest answer to this question in most places, because it is seen as politically incorrect. Here is an answer without the virtue signaling.<br><br>Women do complain, i.e. “nag”, more often than men. There are a lot of gender stereotypes out there, but they are also consider kernels of truth typically. You will see studies of this phenomenon, such as “Nagging: The familial conflict arena” (Diana Boxer, 2000), but only if it can be couched in some oppression for women. In this instance, the article admits women do more nagging but claim that this is due to an imbalance in a power dynamic.<br><br>Yes, it is a power dynamic between men and women, but the cause is not the allegations of patriarchic oppression that politically correct research in the humanities will usually allege.<br><br>The cause is in the way our sexual dimorphism expresses itself. Briefly stated, women tend to get men to provide resources for them and do tasks for them, while men execute on those demands, in order to please women. Men still pay for dinner far more often than women do, even those who proclaim themselves to be feminists just a minute before.<br><br>Getting men to perform tasks is an extension of men being resource providers. Male disposability, such as giving their lives in combat, is an extension of this. Feminists and the politically correct type hate addressing those issues, because it runs counter to the narrative of the patriarchy, so you are not likely to get an intellectually honest answer.<br><br>Evolutionary there was a power imbalance between men and women, so it is true that the root is an imbalance in power and put primarily a division of labor. Despite Patriarchy Theory, men and women did not evolve to compete against each other. That is absolute nonsense. We were far more occupied with survival than fighting against our partners. This division of labor and adaptation of strategies is evolutionary beneficial. Men and women are NOT inherently the same and some of these behaviors can be observed from an early age.<br><br>It is also nonsense that these behaviors are an outgrowth of some, typically unhealthy, relationship dynamic. Women will often times ask their partners to perform a task that they would be perfectly capable of performing themselves. Men tend to be self-sufficient. That is both in part evolutionary and due to socialization. Women will often times ask their partners to perform the task for them. Even when they are genuinely incapable of performing the task, they often times do not have the interest to learn how to perform the task.<br><br>In short, those patterns are an outgrowth of how men and women typically relate to each other and rooted in part in evolution and socialization. Men were supposed to hold open doors or swoop to the rescue of women - something you can see in the replies to this answer by the way, through behavior often referred to as “white knighting”:<br><br>Many males, who proclaim to believe in the equality of the sexes, will defend any statement that is perceived as being critical of women, to appear as the “defender” or “rescuer” of the woman and thereby appear as a protector, manly, a favorable mate. In that very act, and in the often self-castigating manner in which they do so, they contradict their proclaimed believes that women are just as capable to defend themselves as men are, thereby contradiction their belief that they do not really hold or only do so the most superficial manner.<br><br>The concept of “proxy violence” is another pattern often times employed by women in that fashion. Instead of defending themselves, women will often times enlist the help of other men in order to do violence to the man having disrespected them through those men. It is also called “damseling” and you can observe it many instances online where self-proclaimed feminists have been shown to send themselves graphic, aggressive messages in order to provoke sympathy from others. There are many more examples, such as the Münchhausen syndrome. It is also the reason why the phenomenon of mass hysteria predominantly affects women and girls.<br><br>In general, women tend to do more emotional manipulation and work through influencing society, such as smear campaigns, etc., so that others act on behalf of them, in order to protect them. Feminism make gratuitous use of this, often times downplaying what men did for women and the hardship on women, even though men have routinely laid down their lives for women. These are many of the strategies that most (not all) women use to accomplish their goals through others, instead of taking responsibility for themselves.<br><br>There are many, many other ways in which these dynamics manifest themselves. Even the retention of more neotenous are designed to elicit a protective response from others. Th list goes on and on. Women nagging a lot is part of a huge web of behavioral adaptations. To understand this issue better, I suggest you read up on evolutionary biology. Avoid the politically correct research and feminist authors - start with people like Gad Saad that have very approachable YouTube channels. Don’t let the politically correct types dissuade you from reading all sides of this issue.<br><br>Now watch the influx of outraged comments that swoop to the rescue of wymyn - because they are so capable of defending themselves.<br><br>PS: By the way, I think the behaviors of men are just as maladaptive. I have already hinted at “white knighting”. Proxy violence is another one. Whenever we give in to our lower urges, instead of trying to be rational, we tend towards dysfunction. You can see “chivalry” often negative impacting men, who subconsciously at least, try to protect women. One consequence of this is that men get far longer prison sentences for the same crime that women get, up to 60% (see study by Sonja Starr, 2003).<br><br>Often times, instead of logically arguing with facts, we then revert to emotional reasoning, in order to protect women from perceived criticism and attack. This is another outgrowth of the same phenomenon and a reason why free speech has come under such intense attack in the US and elsewhere and why political correctness and social justice issues are currently running rampant throughout the world.<br><br>Basically, what you see happening right now is a dysfunctional, societal outburst of exactly those gender stereotypes that feminism purportedly is trying to fight. Instead, that precise gender adaptation that leads women to nag has taken on a societal scale and has become dysfunctional. No matter how good women have it, feminism portrays men as evil and demands men to help them (“men need to step up”). You can observe the nagging on a small scale in nagging on a big scale, brought about, in part, to the shift in communication media. Today, women will not simply nag “their man” at home but all men in the world.<br><br>This is also the reason why feminism is so absolutely disingenuous, lying about statistics such as the 1 in 4 number for rape (see study by Koss), or glossing over the areas where men fare far worse than women (custody, alimony, work place deaths, combat deaths, homelessness, academic achievement now). The purpose is not gender equality but to get men to do more for women - i.e. nag.<br><br>The strategies than employed when confronted with objective data to the contrary, such as refuting the wage gap, are the same as women employ at home: they are of emotional nature, usually constituting emotional shaming in one form or another. It is perfectly mirrored in the responses from feminist writers who will decry anyone who criticizes feminist ideology as “sexist”, or “woman hating” and labeling detractors as “angry men” (projection, also refer to Lewis’ Law). Those are the same manipulation strategies used by emotional abusers at home on a societal scale.<br><br>The above is the reason why so many manipulation tactics of the feminist movement, which is NOT about equality, has persisted for so long: women do not want to hear the truth, and men gladly swoop in, despite all rationality to the contrary, to give women what they want. If you read up on the history of feminism you will find a wealth of such examples, such as the White Feather Movement.<br><br>So in response to your precise phrasing of your question: It is absolutely evolutionary AND societal. Despite all lip service to gender equality you can see those dynamics being played out virtually everywhere in society in a million of facets. Just start paying attention to it. The easiest way to spot this kind of sexism is to simply reverse the genders in the situation. If you think that the dynamic would have played out completely differently if you swapped the genders, chances are you have such a situation at hand where the above gender dynamics between men and women are being played out.<br><br>And since I am inevitably going to be accused of sexism for not being politically correct, let me add this: I find this pattern as loathsome among women as I find it among men. I think they are responsible for a large portion of society’s ill and I do NOT think that I am making strained associations between the microcosm of the nagging at home and large scale social phenomena. Feminism itself, ironically, since it proclaims to want to alleviate precisely those dynamics, is employing those very same tactics: feminists damsel, even if they live in gated communities, with their worst fear being that their latte was made with whole milk instead of soy milk, and people who are manipulated by this will give to organizations that benefit women who are already swimming in money.<br><br>And that’s another reason women nag: because it works.<br><br>PPS: I forgot another aspect, one which James Damore also mentions in his Google Memo. Women also tend to score high in a trait called “neuroticism” (not used in exactly the same sense as we do informally) in which they tend to be more anxious and cautious. It makes sense, since it is probably beneficial in the care of infants.<br><br>So if women nag more about a perceived risk, such as their partner not seeing the doctor when they should, it might also be an extension of this protectiveness, which is probably one of the most benign instances of nagging. Men tend to neglect their own health more often, as their evolutionary role was usually to protect women and children by sacrificing themselves.<br><br>Actually, some of the social activism we see today, and the reason women were called “the moral gender” during times of Prohibitionism, might be an extension of this need for protection and control of their men/partners. When women organize for the supposed purpose of defending minorities, I think it is another form of “nagging”, viz. them complaining to institutions, legislators, and the government about insufficient protections for a minority that they view as in need of protection, like a group of children or infants. The protective tendencies are projected outward onto a societal level. Some of this was observable during the migrant crisis in Europe and many of the social justice programs in the US.<br><br>The views are often times patronizing and infantilizing, since they are maladaptive and projected onto a minority, such as black Americans. Programs such as affirmative action have been criticized on those grounds by people like Thomas Sowell and others. Instead of being beneficial to the growth and independence of the supposed beneficiaries, those programs and welfare have been shown to have had a detrimental effect, just as the Millennial generation, though the constant coddling and over protectionism, has become incapable, morally stunted, and infantile in their behavior.<br><br>Probably all ills - as well as what has motivated us for doing good - can be traced back to what motivates us as species, which is deeply entangled with how men and women interact in a sexually dimorphic species. There are few social dynamics that cannot be traced back to these relationships in one form or another. The nagging at home is a microcosm of what we see in society in the large - magnified, exasperated, and accelerated through its interactions with modern communication media, i.e. the Internet.<br><br>It is sociological. Women lack the ability to do said thing they are nagging about themselves and thus are stripped of their power- this forces them to do a power-control move on the male in order to feel some kind of control.<br><br>Side note: ever notice that feminism wants the man to split all the household chores but he must also do all the “manly” chores as well?<br>Both nagging and resisting doing the thing being nagged about are part of the same power struggle to control the other's behavior. Nagging directly says "I want to control what you do." Not doing it says "You will not control what I do or do not do." In the end both spouses are diminished by this negative behavior.<br><br>I have learned that saying something more than once is nagging. If it doesn't get done with the first saying, it's time to do it yourself. In other words, control the person who is actually within your control--yourself.<br>Why do wives always nag husbands a lot?<br>Why do so many wives neglect their husbands after becoming mothers? Shouldn’t kids bring the couple closer together yet I’ve seen the opposite in many cases.<br>Why do husbands get irritated at wives?<br>Why do women nag their husbands?<br><br>Because husbands don´t obey them! What do you think of the perspective that women are increasingly becoming entitled, narcissistic control freaks and tyrants in a way once associated with authoritarian males? Then wives complain that men are wimps, lack initiative and dont deliver when the lights go out. Your thoughts?<br><br>A funny joke about how times have changed goes like this:<br><br>1890´s: Trip announced to see relatives: Father: "Charlotte we are going to New Jersey next Sunday. Wife replies: "Yes darling-what should we bring?" Robbie replies "yes father"<br><br>1950´s Wife: "<br><br>I believe that's part of the job description. Hold on, let me check...<br><br>Yup. There it is in black and white. Section 2 Sub-section B.<br><br>"Wife gets to ask hubby to do things that should have been done without asking, weeks or months ago."<br><br>There's also an addendum that reads:<br><br>"Husbands will call this 'nagging'. They're lazy dopes, don't listen to them."<br>Because when a husband tells his wife to do something, he's exercising his right to assert his authority in his household.<br><br>But when a woman tells a man to do something she's "nagging."<br><br>It's all in the wording.<br>The X chromosome that women have is responsible for housekeeping functions. Women's brains secrete different levels if neurotransmitters. Hormones further effect a difference in the expression of genes. Since housekeeping tasks are responsible for day to day living, they remind males about undone tasks. This critical function is wrongly perceived by the male brain as nagging.<br>Same reason men ignore what their wives say. Neither one always wants the same things as the other and this is how they try to get what they believe they deserve.</td></tr>

I created 25 and it won't let me create more.<br>How many playlists can I create on YouTube?<br>You are limited to 12 playlist sections which are not the same as playlists. Playlist sections are the areas on your YouTube homepage that you put playlists in. I have about 60 playlists at the moment and I’m always adding more without a problem.<br><br>So far the only problem I’ve had is playlists disappearing and that’s easily fixed by going into YouTube Studio, select the Playlists tab, and change your settings from Public, Unlisted, or Private and back to whichever setting you prefer for each playlist and this “wakes-up” the playlist for your YouTube dashboard to work as before.<br><br>I’ve tried adding a new item and deleting/re-adding an item to a playlist but that doesn’t work all the time but the above does.<br><br>Edit: If a creator has deleted or hidden a video that’s being used as a thumbnail in the playlist, it will cause the playlist to disappear and you’ll notice this if the thumbnail is blank. All you have to do to fix this is remove the deleted or hidden video from your playlist and refresh your screen and the playlist will return.<br><br>If the playlist is no longer visible, go to your dashboard, select the “playlists” tab on the left-hand side of your screen and all your playlists will be found there, Just delete the hidden or deleted video, save changes, and you’re set. You may have to refresh your screen for the playlist to show back up after this.<br><br>How do I start a channel on YouTube?<br>Just start with whatever you have.<br><br>You just need :<br><br>Internet connection<br>A basic mobile<br>Desire to make content<br>Be consistent as “It takes time”<br><br>Here's an example : He is an inspiration.<br><br>His journey has inspired millions of people on LinkedIn.❤️<br><br><br><br>Source : MN Hemant @MNHemant<br><br>Do subscribe his channel, he is really passionate and hardworking.<br><br>What are NSA and SA networks in 5G?<br>5G is the next generation of network that promises incredible data speeds, high network capacity and low latency.<br><br><br>This 5G can operate at pretty much any frequency from 600 MHz to 40 GHz today, including the current ones that we already use for cellular communications.<br><br>The 5G network will be implemented in a two step process in a NSA and SA architecture.<br><br>The first step is known as NSA, or non-standalone, where cellular operators can utilize the majority of their 4G infrastructure to operate their 5G networks. it also means that early 5G devices will have to be simultaneously connected to 4G and 5G<br><br>I don’t think there is a limit. I have many. I have many on another account, probably well over 30. Are you sure this isn’t just a glitch?<br><br>In cause u can create only 25 playlist on YouTube But you can add up to 500+ videos on a Playlist<br><br>Is starting a YouTube channel a good option in 2020?<br>Yes, it is the good time to start a YouTube channel but I am quite unsure of what you meant by the phrase “good option”.<br><br>If you are starting a Youtube channel for the money then you better stay out of it at all. Long story short, Youtube isn't gonna pay you some crazy amount of money in the short run or sometimes not even in the long term, so if your primary focus is money then stay away from Youtube, go get a real job.<br><br>But if you have a talent,<br><br>Or possess a certain skill,<br><br>Or love to entertain others,<br><br>Or you are simply passionate about making Youtube videos then it is the perfect time to start a Yo<br><br>Can you create an unlimited number of playlists on YouTube?<br>Hello, for a fast answser to your question: No.<br><br>You can’t create more than 20 000 playlist on YouTube I tried myself and I get the following message on YouTube after making the 20001st playlist.<br><br><br>Why on earth are you making 25 playlists per day??<br><br>What's currently on your playlist?<br>Q.
