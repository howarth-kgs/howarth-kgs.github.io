The survey, comprising 16 nations and 16,254 adult internet users, found that seven out of 10 in India encountered tech support scams in the past year.<br><br>Basically India has the cheapest English-speaking labor of any country with a government and law enforcement that are too slow to react to illegal practices to prevent them.<br><br>India has a population of 1.3B+ , 15℅ of the world's population. A lot of them are unemployed and struggling with poverty. They are bought into this scamming business on the virtue of commission. Also, our beloved neighbors Bangladesh and Pakistan are also equally involved in this scamming business but since all our accents are more or less similar, they also pass off as Indian scammers.<br><br><br>I do want these things to stop. It sounds really pathetic that people are making a business out of scamming old people or people who are not that familiar with internet. Anyway, karma is there to take care of them.<br><br>I am also a big fan of a YouTube channel called Scammer Payback. I love how he scams the scammers themselves.<br><br>Take care everyone :)<br><br>Not just Indian but other cultures as well such as Nigerians. To them its a lucrative way to make a living.<br><br>I get targeted so often through Facebook and Instragram. Telling them you are older, happily married and have kids has no affect on them. They still pursue you like a love sick puppy.<br><br>I have strung a few alomg to see what happens. They get quite agressive demanding to know where you are, are you at home now, where do you live etc.<br><br>Once you know what to look for they are easily spotted and dealth with.<br><br>I’ve also had three scam emails answering two car adverts i listed online recently. Not sure if they are Indian as such but i did speak to one on the phone and he was definitely middle eastern of some decent.<br><br>Can I hack a scammer?<br>Hacking scammers, it is simple!<br><br>I’ve done it many times, or worse let them infect their own computers, they seem to just disappear offline! ☺<br><br>Many scammers have no idea of where they target. Spammers are better, it’s simple to put some malware together so you get all their info, and hack their webcams, but disable the webcam LED. They have no idea they are infected, because their own computers never have their antivirus updated.<br><br>Normally, you see a group of about 12 people in a room on really old computers, they have no idea about security, which is why it is so easy to take them out.<br><br>There’s a co<br><br>Why are there so many tech support scammers in India?<br>Because the Indian police refuse to do anything about it.<br><br>You can literally say here the scammer is called XXXX and works at YYYYY and they will do absolutely nothing about it. They have a “cyber police” department, but they don’t bother to lift a finger to investigate.<br><br>I see a lot of answers from Indians with their whataboutism about how scammers exist everywhere, or how look at company XYZ scams you from USA… yes .. but India is number one at scamming.<br><br>Why ? Greed.<br><br>It’s not muh bollywood and people wanting better life, I mean we have hollywood too and there are a lot more rich folk in USA than in India but the number of Indian scammers is huge and the major reason why ? Zero repercussions. They’re not going to jail .. because India tacitly approves of this sort of stuff.<br><br>Prove me wrong.<br><br>I recently became aware that there is no conept in the Indian culture equivalent to concept represented by the word Lie. So in other words, they say whatever is necessary to accomplish the task at hand. Its not a lie of you dont know what the concept of a lie is. This explains a lot, and its sad to say that I have worked with indians directly.<br><br>I would like to go firmly against your statement that the only reason Indians scam is due to greed.<br><br>Because there are so many people in India, just having a diploma/degree does not guarantee a job. There is extreme jb competition present, families become helpless and people even go to the level of suicide due to the lack of a career.<br><br>So people turn to sneaky ways to earn their living. Even off other people’s lives. Initially, they surely feel wrong about scamming the vulnerable of their life savings, but over time they just get used to it and the feeling of guilt evaporates.<br><br>I agree that scamming is incorrect and that the government is not very strict in its efforts to scam crackdown, but greed is not the only reason that drives people to wrong ways.<br><br>If you don’t have money, commit suicide like a gentleman and don’t scam others. Besides, who told you to fuck without a condom to then realize that children cost money? Nobody, it was your choice. Therefore doing harm to scammers in india is your moral duty if you are a hacker. Aswell as hacking the indian government to blackmail them into taking action.<br><br>that's precisely what a high American cult leader would say right there<br><br>your opinion is as clouded as your level of understanding<br><br>let me tell you attacking wrongdoers is not the way to deal with criminals or government people, you’ve got to bring about awareness and helpful strategies. think about that for a second, any fool could run around shouting that all Indian scammers and government authorities are bound to hell. it takes more effort to actually bring about a positive change.<br><br>radically opposing the scamming industry might give a short term reduction, but they will reoccur and bounce back, with stronger tactics and bigger goals. they might even plan on taking their revenge on all those non-progressive shitholes who ruined their business.<br><br>Or perhaps you reject victims because you reject any part of yourself you deem as weak, thus always try to be strong, thus always find the good in everything. The part of you that cannot blame a person who harms others might need you to understand something.<br><br>There are those who commit suicide, suffer from anxiety, depression, constant sorrow caused from misdirected guilt and shame.<br><br>These people have a low self-esteem and don’t know how to feel worthy.<br><br>And there are those who rob, scam, steal, abuse, reject, deny, manipulate, ridicule, stalk, bully, torment, intimidate, lie and worse.<br><br>These types never feel guilt and they are often enabled by the former type.<br><br>Maybe I am off base but one day you may feel thankful there are people willing to punish and put evil where it belongs.<br><br>Let’s just hope for your sake that day doesn’t come with you as one of their victims, having had to learn the hard way!<br><br>I get the whole unconditional loving, empathetic, evolved higher perspective.<br><br>We must all find balance.<br><br>arent empathy, love and forgiveness what enabled us, humans, to develop into the social beings we are today?<br><br>a world where mercy and a chance to improve and correct oneself exists is the only type where actual progress may ever be seen.<br><br>it is not just in this part of the world, too…. can you, with a clear conscience, claim that fair treatment or second chances were never provided to you in your life? and that it was for the best? where would we all have been, if we were put to death or worse, for wrong deeds we commit? would civilization ever exist the way it is now?<br><br>Both of you are right with your point. I’m just gonna add my point. My point is, there are some ppl are too lost to become good again. They have no morality, no heart or soul. Is it fair to us to give them the same treatment? No. Those people belongs where they should belong. Reality is, you gotta pay for your consequences, you can’t just scam people and get away with it. If no one willing to pay, there will me more people becoming that because they thought they can get away with it, why not do it. Some people are just too lost to even realize that they need to become better. Tell me I’m wrong but in reality, I know there are people have no moral at all, socialpath, psychopath. Bottom line is, when you commit a crime, dangerous to others, it’s only right that you need to be faced with justice. Because morality and justice are the things that keep us human remain humane and be righteous.<br><br>I get the whole empathy and second chance thing. But in order to give people that might capable of changing for the better, we need to put evil at bay and use justice to show people what’s right and what’s wrong. And only those people who willing to change and regret of their actions, they will receive the community love, support and empathy. But other than that, they can’t just tell us to keep give them a chance, to not charge them, give them empathy and sympathy, but they still commit crimes, still scam people. How many more chance do we have to give those people like that? How much love and empathy do we have to give people like that so that one day hoping they can change? No, it doesn’t work like that. And that’s how justice comes into play. That’s why we need people who work for the law or government to help us stopping this.<br><br>In the eye of Gods, that’s a sin. But if you willing to change, ask for forgiveness and really put it into action and not just all talk. Then you earn the right to receive second chance and sympathy. Because those things that you said, need to be earned. Second chance, sympathy, empathy and support. Because I will never support, or sympathize to those won’t change, period.<br><br>We’re talking from the standpoint of morality. But there are those who don’t and we try to correct them and make them think the same way we do. Besides, morality and values comes from us. Why, then, does it matter if scammers, who are humans, scam if we think objectively? We reason that it helps other people, but how about the scammers? If the scammers do not align with our moral code, we stop treating them as humans. But let’s switch this around. What if, in a world with scammers, a person with a moral code similar to ours preaches their standards? The scammers would stop treating THEM as humans. They are also the normals of that world. This discrepancy of societal standards is why I hate morals. I feel indifferent to scammers and victims cause I understand why the both of them would do it. Even if the scammer is being an asshole, it’s the product of their brain similar to how being nice is the product of our brain. We may argue that empathy and such is essential to life but life has no true purpose. It is insignificant to the greater world out there, so why does morality matter? If we think about it, it only benefits those who have a similar set of morals. Anyways, I apologize for ranting. Just had to get my reply out there.<br><br>bingo there, since its such a lawless place I figure we could just send the military over and deal with them. And USA should if they care that much about money, hey guys EAST INDIANS are stealing it from you and YOU do nothing. I’m Canadian, and no we’re not all anti violence.<br><br>For one, DROP A 500 pound bomb on… ONE call center, proceed to watch the pure panick and unwillingness for ANY one else die’ing just to scam people. Hey call it inhumane… BUT IT WOULD WORK.<br><br>Try it.<br><br>I don't think that's true from a percentage stand point. India has more number of scammers because the population is large. Hence India has huge number of doctors, engineers and lawyers. Percentage of people involved in these activities would be really low if you look at it from a percentage of entire population.<br><br>Yeah, but still India has most number of scammers. And that's affecting the world. You don't say from a percentage standpoint, Jamaica has earned more gold medals in the Olympics than America, do you? We need to accept that our country has a lot of scum that needs to be cleaned.<br><br>You are right. Police does not do anything.<br><br>This is the correct answer. The Indian culture doesn't have anything that prohibits you from stealing from others , as long as you don't steal from your own its fine. And Indians always see foreigners as others and people to exploit<br><br>Its not about “India promoting this sort of stuff"….The law and order in India in general is screwed up. This isn't a specefic case in which there is no action taken…almost everything is like this.<br><br>Linenecy of cops. They don't act like they r cops. They are themselves corrupted.<br><br>Amazing… Every word of what you just said was right<br><br>I agree man. I am an Indian, but i dont want to call myself as an Indian because of many scammers. the thing is that people from the early age of High School start developing the desire for money because their parents don’t do shit. So the real culprits are : 99.99% of the Indian Parents. Greed is the most in India compared to any other country, and the reason : Indian parents not providing their kids with efficient basic resources. Now almost every parent in India (including my parents ) act like “ If you don’t get good grades, I won’t provide you with food for the entire day tomorrow “. Now If Indian Parents stop acting this harsh towards their kid and remove the “ need to be perfect student “ logic, this kinda stuff would go down rapidly. Now I won’t say that it will be eradicated completely, because there are a few idiotic brain dead un-fit to live kids in our country, who will do anything for money. But the real cause of the problem are Parents.<br><br>Damn, so the Indian Government is to blame? Bruh, no wonder there’s so many compared to other nations.<br><br>Partly yes. But, there are sincere police. These people evade coz the contacts they have in the law enforcement warn them first hand. If they get caught, they'll go to jail.<br><br>Scammers are not going to jail in india because there are no victims in india except outside country. Plus the American government doesn't give a big fat damn<br><br>Wrong, there are victims in India too.<br><br>Yup. These scam callers keep calling me for no reason everyday.<br><br>lol.<br><br>You could say the same thing for crypto soyboys in my inbox. There's such an influx of them it's ridiculous.<br><br>Why are so many phone scam call centers located in India?<br>Scam call centers always existed in India. However, after 2017 situation changed drastically. India saw a record number of unemployment. And millions of newly graduated youths needed jobs to start their lives. This is then when things got out of hands. These youths knew better English. They were technically sound but there were no jobs for them in India. So, the number of scam call centers grew dramatically.<br><br>Nowadays, scam call centers recruit not just freshly graduated people but also undergraduate students. In many cases, scammers are doing courses in IT. Indian Government is aware of this si<br><br>How can scammers, like those that call with an Indian accent and claim to be from Microsoft Tech support or the IRS, live with themselves?<br>I actually had a long conversation with one of these scammers while pretending to go along with his scam. After making small talk I then asked him if he believed in God, he said “Of Course I do” so I asked him “How can you live with yourself doing these scams? Do you think Our Creator will accept this?” He got emotional and said that this was how he supports his family. I gave him some advice on how to find a legal means of making money.<br><br>I personally feel that the United Nations should hold India accountable for this. Considering that these Call Centers are a Major Source of Income in India their Government is fully aware of these Illegal Activities but since they're making Tons of Money from it they do not shut them down.<br><br>How I can post my experience with a scammer?<br>You better don't get outed as a victim.<br><br>What do you think, that here, like on all social media, are no scammers ready to attack you to milk you out (jargon), you better avoid that and search for professional treatments for psychological support. Anyway I answer for my mother, but your question sounds more than strange. 🎶<br><br>All of these phone scammers with Indian-like accents. What country are they calling from?<br>They could be from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or Philippines. They use fake accent. Some of them are located here. Don’t share any personal information with them. Tell them to leave their phone number and you will get back to them. You can check their veracity with the agency which claim to be representing.<br><br>Can I track a scammer?<br>Scammers mostly think they can hide from the law enforcement agencies. The update in the tracking technology developed by law enforcement agencies can fish out the scammers location and also track payments to see where it has been redirected.

Find Brian Anfield’s quora profile and blog<br><br>Do scammers use internet Hangout site?<br>It’s one of their favorite app to use. Their aim is to get victims on dating sites or instagram then tell them to chat them up on hangout because they can’t be reported unlike other apps like instagram, facebook and dating sites where they and reported and blocked.

Because nobody likes to admit that they did something stupid even though it may be a case of miss placed trust with a side of stupid. And our society is only too happy to let you know how smart they are and how stupid you are.

Why do women nag generally — is it biological or sociological?<br>You will not get an honest answer to this question in most places, because it is seen as politically incorrect. Here is an answer without the virtue signaling.<br><br>Women do complain, i.e. “nag”, more often than men. There are a lot of gender stereotypes out there, but they are also consider kernels of truth typically. You will see studies of this phenomenon, such as “Nagging: The familial conflict arena” (Diana Boxer, 2000), but only if it can be couched in some oppression for women. In this instance, the article admits women do more nagging but claim that this is due to an imbalance in a power dynamic.<br><br>Yes, it is a power dynamic between men and women, but the cause is not the allegations of patriarchic oppression that politically correct research in the humanities will usually allege.<br><br>The cause is in the way our sexual dimorphism expresses itself. Briefly stated, women tend to get men to provide resources for them and do tasks for them, while men execute on those demands, in order to please women. Men still pay for dinner far more often than women do, even those who proclaim themselves to be feminists just a minute before.<br><br>Getting men to perform tasks is an extension of men being resource providers. Male disposability, such as giving their lives in combat, is an extension of this. Feminists and the politically correct type hate addressing those issues, because it runs counter to the narrative of the patriarchy, so you are not likely to get an intellectually honest answer.<br><br>Evolutionary there was a power imbalance between men and women, so it is true that the root is an imbalance in power and put primarily a division of labor. Despite Patriarchy Theory, men and women did not evolve to compete against each other. That is absolute nonsense. We were far more occupied with survival than fighting against our partners. This division of labor and adaptation of strategies is evolutionary beneficial. Men and women are NOT inherently the same and some of these behaviors can be observed from an early age.<br><br>It is also nonsense that these behaviors are an outgrowth of some, typically unhealthy, relationship dynamic. Women will often times ask their partners to perform a task that they would be perfectly capable of performing themselves. Men tend to be self-sufficient. That is both in part evolutionary and due to socialization. Women will often times ask their partners to perform the task for them. Even when they are genuinely incapable of performing the task, they often times do not have the interest to learn how to perform the task.<br><br>In short, those patterns are an outgrowth of how men and women typically relate to each other and rooted in part in evolution and socialization. Men were supposed to hold open doors or swoop to the rescue of women - something you can see in the replies to this answer by the way, through behavior often referred to as “white knighting”:<br><br>Many males, who proclaim to believe in the equality of the sexes, will defend any statement that is perceived as being critical of women, to appear as the “defender” or “rescuer” of the woman and thereby appear as a protector, manly, a favorable mate. In that very act, and in the often self-castigating manner in which they do so, they contradict their proclaimed believes that women are just as capable to defend themselves as men are, thereby contradiction their belief that they do not really hold or only do so the most superficial manner.<br><br>The concept of “proxy violence” is another pattern often times employed by women in that fashion. Instead of defending themselves, women will often times enlist the help of other men in order to do violence to the man having disrespected them through those men. It is also called “damseling” and you can observe it many instances online where self-proclaimed feminists have been shown to send themselves graphic, aggressive messages in order to provoke sympathy from others. There are many more examples, such as the Münchhausen syndrome. It is also the reason why the phenomenon of mass hysteria predominantly affects women and girls.<br><br>In general, women tend to do more emotional manipulation and work through influencing society, such as smear campaigns, etc., so that others act on behalf of them, in order to protect them. Feminism make gratuitous use of this, often times downplaying what men did for women and the hardship on women, even though men have routinely laid down their lives for women. These are many of the strategies that most (not all) women use to accomplish their goals through others, instead of taking responsibility for themselves.<br><br>There are many, many other ways in which these dynamics manifest themselves. Even the retention of more neotenous are designed to elicit a protective response from others. Th list goes on and on. Women nagging a lot is part of a huge web of behavioral adaptations. To understand this issue better, I suggest you read up on evolutionary biology. Avoid the politically correct research and feminist authors - start with people like Gad Saad that have very approachable YouTube channels. Don’t let the politically correct types dissuade you from reading all sides of this issue.<br><br>Now watch the influx of outraged comments that swoop to the rescue of wymyn - because they are so capable of defending themselves.<br><br>PS: By the way, I think the behaviors of men are just as maladaptive. I have already hinted at “white knighting”. Proxy violence is another one. Whenever we give in to our lower urges, instead of trying to be rational, we tend towards dysfunction. You can see “chivalry” often negative impacting men, who subconsciously at least, try to protect women. One consequence of this is that men get far longer prison sentences for the same crime that women get, up to 60% (see study by Sonja Starr, 2003).<br><br>Often times, instead of logically arguing with facts, we then revert to emotional reasoning, in order to protect women from perceived criticism and attack. This is another outgrowth of the same phenomenon and a reason why free speech has come under such intense attack in the US and elsewhere and why political correctness and social justice issues are currently running rampant throughout the world.<br><br>Basically, what you see happening right now is a dysfunctional, societal outburst of exactly those gender stereotypes that feminism purportedly is trying to fight. Instead, that precise gender adaptation that leads women to nag has taken on a societal scale and has become dysfunctional. No matter how good women have it, feminism portrays men as evil and demands men to help them (“men need to step up”). You can observe the nagging on a small scale in nagging on a big scale, brought about, in part, to the shift in communication media. Today, women will not simply nag “their man” at home but all men in the world.<br><br>This is also the reason why feminism is so absolutely disingenuous, lying about statistics such as the 1 in 4 number for rape (see study by Koss), or glossing over the areas where men fare far worse than women (custody, alimony, work place deaths, combat deaths, homelessness, academic achievement now). The purpose is not gender equality but to get men to do more for women - i.e. nag.<br><br>The strategies than employed when confronted with objective data to the contrary, such as refuting the wage gap, are the same as women employ at home: they are of emotional nature, usually constituting emotional shaming in one form or another. It is perfectly mirrored in the responses from feminist writers who will decry anyone who criticizes feminist ideology as “sexist”, or “woman hating” and labeling detractors as “angry men” (projection, also refer to Lewis’ Law). Those are the same manipulation strategies used by emotional abusers at home on a societal scale.<br><br>The above is the reason why so many manipulation tactics of the feminist movement, which is NOT about equality, has persisted for so long: women do not want to hear the truth, and men gladly swoop in, despite all rationality to the contrary, to give women what they want. If you read up on the history of feminism you will find a wealth of such examples, such as the White Feather Movement.<br><br>So in response to your precise phrasing of your question: It is absolutely evolutionary AND societal. Despite all lip service to gender equality you can see those dynamics being played out virtually everywhere in society in a million of facets. Just start paying attention to it. The easiest way to spot this kind of sexism is to simply reverse the genders in the situation. If you think that the dynamic would have played out completely differently if you swapped the genders, chances are you have such a situation at hand where the above gender dynamics between men and women are being played out.<br><br>And since I am inevitably going to be accused of sexism for not being politically correct, let me add this: I find this pattern as loathsome among women as I find it among men. I think they are responsible for a large portion of society’s ill and I do NOT think that I am making strained associations between the microcosm of the nagging at home and large scale social phenomena. Feminism itself, ironically, since it proclaims to want to alleviate precisely those dynamics, is employing those very same tactics: feminists damsel, even if they live in gated communities, with their worst fear being that their latte was made with whole milk instead of soy milk, and people who are manipulated by this will give to organizations that benefit women who are already swimming in money.<br><br>And that’s another reason women nag: because it works.<br><br>PPS: I forgot another aspect, one which James Damore also mentions in his Google Memo. Women also tend to score high in a trait called “neuroticism” (not used in exactly the same sense as we do informally) in which they tend to be more anxious and cautious. It makes sense, since it is probably beneficial in the care of infants.<br><br>So if women nag more about a perceived risk, such as their partner not seeing the doctor when they should, it might also be an extension of this protectiveness, which is probably one of the most benign instances of nagging. Men tend to neglect their own health more often, as their evolutionary role was usually to protect women and children by sacrificing themselves.<br><br>Actually, some of the social activism we see today, and the reason women were called “the moral gender” during times of Prohibitionism, might be an extension of this need for protection and control of their men/partners. When women organize for the supposed purpose of defending minorities, I think it is another form of “nagging”, viz. them complaining to institutions, legislators, and the government about insufficient protections for a minority that they view as in need of protection, like a group of children or infants. The protective tendencies are projected outward onto a societal level. Some of this was observable during the migrant crisis in Europe and many of the social justice programs in the US.<br><br>The views are often times patronizing and infantilizing, since they are maladaptive and projected onto a minority, such as black Americans. Programs such as affirmative action have been criticized on those grounds by people like Thomas Sowell and others. Instead of being beneficial to the growth and independence of the supposed beneficiaries, those programs and welfare have been shown to have had a detrimental effect, just as the Millennial generation, though the constant coddling and over protectionism, has become incapable, morally stunted, and infantile in their behavior.<br><br>Probably all ills - as well as what has motivated us for doing good - can be traced back to what motivates us as species, which is deeply entangled with how men and women interact in a sexually dimorphic species. There are few social dynamics that cannot be traced back to these relationships in one form or another. The nagging at home is a microcosm of what we see in society in the large - magnified, exasperated, and accelerated through its interactions with modern communication media, i.e. the Internet.<br><br>It is sociological. Women lack the ability to do said thing they are nagging about themselves and thus are stripped of their power- this forces them to do a power-control move on the male in order to feel some kind of control.<br><br>Side note: ever notice that feminism wants the man to split all the household chores but he must also do all the “manly” chores as well?<br>Both nagging and resisting doing the thing being nagged about are part of the same power struggle to control the other's behavior. Nagging directly says "I want to control what you do." Not doing it says "You will not control what I do or do not do." In the end both spouses are diminished by this negative behavior.<br><br>I have learned that saying something more than once is nagging. If it doesn't get done with the first saying, it's time to do it yourself. In other words, control the person who is actually within your control--yourself.<br>Why do wives always nag husbands a lot?<br>Why do so many wives neglect their husbands after becoming mothers? Shouldn’t kids bring the couple closer together yet I’ve seen the opposite in many cases.<br>Why do husbands get irritated at wives?<br>Why do women nag their husbands?<br><br>Because husbands don´t obey them! What do you think of the perspective that women are increasingly becoming entitled, narcissistic control freaks and tyrants in a way once associated with authoritarian males? Then wives complain that men are wimps, lack initiative and dont deliver when the lights go out. Your thoughts?<br><br>A funny joke about how times have changed goes like this:<br><br>1890´s: Trip announced to see relatives: Father: "Charlotte we are going to New Jersey next Sunday. Wife replies: "Yes darling-what should we bring?" Robbie replies "yes father"<br><br>1950´s Wife: "<br><br>I believe that's part of the job description. Hold on, let me check...<br><br>Yup. There it is in black and white. Section 2 Sub-section B.<br><br>"Wife gets to ask hubby to do things that should have been done without asking, weeks or months ago."<br><br>There's also an addendum that reads:<br><br>"Husbands will call this 'nagging'. They're lazy dopes, don't listen to them."<br>Because when a husband tells his wife to do something, he's exercising his right to assert his authority in his household.<br><br>But when a woman tells a man to do something she's "nagging."<br><br>It's all in the wording.<br>The X chromosome that women have is responsible for housekeeping functions. Women's brains secrete different levels if neurotransmitters. Hormones further effect a difference in the expression of genes. Since housekeeping tasks are responsible for day to day living, they remind males about undone tasks. This critical function is wrongly perceived by the male brain as nagging.<br>Same reason men ignore what their wives say. Neither one always wants the same things as the other and this is how they try to get what they believe they deserve.</td></tr>

<tr align="top"><td class="c s2em fTNR bgReadingOrange" colspan="2">https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Indians-so-insecure-and-constantly-comparing-their-culture-with-other-cultures<BR><BR>Why are Indians so insecure and constantly comparing their culture with other cultures?<br>Because India and Indians (Hindus in particular) suffer from a cultural inferiority complex.<br><br>As a person of Indian origin, whose great grandparents left West Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh to settle in the West Indies, having spent six months in Allahabad. I can tell you Indians have a huge inferiority complex when it comes to Western and to an lesser extent Islamic culture.<br><br>One must not forget that for the last 500 years with the exception of a relatively short Maratha interbellum, Northern India has been ruled by foreign powers. This left deep wounds within the Indian cultural psyche.<br><br>Especially the British with the implementation of their educational system left a deep mark in the Indian consciousness.<br><br>Why do you think most Indians who can afford to do so send their children to English medium schools ? Why do you think people prefer to dress in western clothes rather than native garments? Why do you think people buy fairness creams to make their skin lighter ? Why do you think upper class people often converse in English with one another ? Why do you think Indians who can’t even hold a conversation in English with a foreigner, use some much English vocabulary in their everyday speaking?<br><br>If you compare this with let's say Emiratis. They where there traditional garments with pride, they speak their language with pride, they send their children to Arab medium schools.<br><br>We Indians are only patriotic when it comes to attacking Pakistan. Not when it comes honouring our language, culture and values.<br><br>Jai Bharat, Jai Hind<br><br>Let’s be honest. Because India is a poor, dirty and overpopulated country and deep inside Indians know that. But they don’t want to accept that, so they deny it.<br><br>Don’t downvote, face the reality.<br><br>Because we want validation.<br><br>See, from our childhood we are taught by our society and our education system that India has the best culture and tradition. The mark that this jingoistic statement leaves on the mind of many people is ever lasting. We are made to believe that whatever is western is uncultured and against the values of our great cultural heritage.<br><br>The point is, this is not true. We have as many cultural biases and ridiculous customs as many other western countries, maybe even more. In the age of information, the generation that was taught the notion about greatness of culture feels cheated and hence goes out of their way to validate their belief on the internet. This is where the comparisons start and this is how the insecurity creeps in.<br><br>When you see other countries making immense progress in equality and liberty and we are still stuck with a shitload of casteism and other problems, maybe a slightest of positive validation feels good. Check quora for the answers by people of other countries mentioning the Indian culture in the slightest positive light and look at the amount of up-votes it gets.<br><br>Also, Indians are sociologically programmed to seek validation from the peer group. We think a lot about what others think of us. We marry children on the basis of what others will think. We choose our education on the basis of what others will think. We even eat, drink and have fun based on the validation by the society. So yeah, asking people on quora about our culture is not that big a deal for us.<br><br>Are Indians insecure? Or proud? Or nationalistic? Or simply not exposed?<br>Why are Indians serious, insecure, and in a rush to do everything?<br>Are Indians in general more insecure about our culture? Why is something new always trashed as "aping the west"?<br>What do you honestly hate about Indian culture while being an Indian yourself?<br>Being an Indian here are things I and some Indians hate about our culture:<br><br>1] Forced arranged marrages Parents force their kids to marry some one against their will, but this dosent happen much due to westernization.but marriages are still completely controlled by the parents, they always make sure that the girl or guy is from the same state, country,religion and the guy should be having an equal or higher economic status than the girl. and also some parents are even so conscious about his/hers personality. A lot of parents even brainwash their kids to marry only a Indian girl or guy and not a foreign girl or guy by telling them so since young age, because they feel that conflict and a divorce will be caused due to culture and mentality differences witch doesnt happen with everyone, there are some Indians that are open minded in embracing other cultures, even Indians who chose to permanently migrate to other countries follow this mentality blindly.<br><br>2] Narrowmindedness when it comes to clothing, spending money, dating, career paths, sexuality, gender norms, gender roles, alcohol and life decisions [everyone wants to do only what the next person is doing or what is considered as the right thing according to the Indian culture]. Indians are completely against anything which is out of the box although it might be good for them .parents being to strict and restrictive to their kids, irrespective of the age of the kid.<br><br>3] Double standards or sexism: which is absolutely ridiculous<br><br>A girl wearing a sari which exposes her back and belly its considered to be acceptable, where as a girl wearing casual clothing or jeggings which exposes a little bit of skin is considered as uncultured.<br>A girl can stay at home and be a house wife if she wanted to, but a guy needs to have a job of high or equal economic status of the girl or her family for the marriage to be considered as acceptable. Men are seen as a womens persional ATM machine by society. Alotough women do have the right to work and get paid equally, its not so socially acceptable for the man to stay at home while the wife works and the women and her parents decide on marring the guy based on his carrer/ job and how much money he earns.<br>A guy can have as manny women as he wants but if a girl is seen with a different guy she loses her self respect.<br>For women all jobs are considered as suitable except for jobs involving operating heavy machinery and construction work. If women are seen doing those kinds of jobs which is rare its considered as female empowerment but if a guy is seen doing feminine jobs like fashion designing, stylist, beautician, nurcing, receptionist etc, its considered to be shameful or embarrasing.<br>Society stresses more on men respecting and supporting women instead of both genders respecting and supporting each other.<br>Girls can walk around wearing a bit of male clothing, accessories and do manly things and get praised for it, but if a guy shaves or waxes off his body hair (which is kind of normal in the west and its also known as manscaping), shapes his eyebrows, pierces his ears (which is also normal in the west), grows his hair up till his shoulders and does anything that is a feminine, he gets judged or mocked.<br>People believe in an inaccurate steryotype that all girls are more intellegent, well behaved and mature than all boys which is inacurrate. Gender has no influence in that. Some people think that girls/women are always inocent and that they can never be bad or wrong with is ridiculous. Irrespective of gender everyone has their own personality trait and other phycological characteristics which infuence the intellegence, behaviour and maturity of a person.<br>4] Toxic masculinity: Just because an average man is bigger and physically stronger than an average woman, people believe in the outdated stereotype that all men are extremely strong (mentally and physically) which isnt accurate. People act like as if men are borm with an iron body and mind.<br><br>if a guy is seen acting emotional or acting weak or crying he is told to “be a man” or “don’t act like a girl” or “you are a man you can do it” by other people. in classrooms if a boy is seen not sitting up straight or fidgeting he is told to stop sitting or acting like a girl by the teacher.<br><br>All men are expected to like sports. if a guy dislikes sports people mock him and call him a girl. Its okay or normal for a man not to like sports. All men cant be the same, we all have our differences.<br><br>Indian society believes that men cannot be harrased, abused, assulted and raped by a women which is just inaccurate. All men are sterotypes as perverts and some girls feel extremely unsafe around unknown men. Some people think that boys cant be shy and being shy is a feminine trait which is highly false. People think that its not normal for a guy to be ebarassed to show off his body or a bit of skin which is also false, some boys do feel embarrased too which is normal.<br><br>In my opinion i think that it is absolutely okay for a man to cry and express his emotions because believe or not it actually makes a person mentally stronger and it helps them relieve themselves from depression. When a person suppresses his or her emotions it can lead to self harm, homicide and suicide. Altough men are phycally bigger and stronger than women on average, it is possible for a man to be weak. For a man to be extremely strong he has to exersise or something which is something that not all men do, they dont just naturally have a lage amouth of strength so its okay for a man to be weak. We live in a domesticated world men can survive without being extremely physically strong.<br><br>Men are humans beings just like women and they do have feeling and emotions to. Too much of anything is bad and everything must be done in moderation. Being to emotional is not okay for a man or a women because, life can be unfair or hard sometimes and a person needs to be a little tough in order to easily handle difficult situations in life.<br><br>In my opinion there is no reason for men to be proving their masculinity or to be expected to act in a certain way and men should be given the social right to get out of ger norms just how women do.<br><br>5]Students being pressurized to study- Parents always expect their kids to score high grades and compare the grades, studying skills and study habits to other kids without taking into consideration his/her strengths ,weaknesses and career path. Parents like to brag about the childs accomplishments to other people and those people feel insecure and pressurise thair kids to work harder and score higrer grades. The syllabus is so vast, children from grade 9 onwards are always being expected to study for long hours by the parents and parents force their kinds into career parts which the kid has no interest in just for the sake of social status. There are few parents who take into consideration the child's strengths and weakness before expecting anything and allowing the child to choose the career path of his/her interest. Some parents are so strict they don’t even allow their kids to have a hobby appart from school work. Kids spend too much time in studies they have less time to enjoy their childhood, learn about the real world develop their social skills and other life skills etc. Some kids take too much pressure in studies that they end up committing suicide either because they think they or going to fail or because they already filed or because they scored less marks and are unable to get admission at a desired college, there were even cases where the kid ended his/her life just because he/she received 10 marks less than expected. Parents dont allow their kids to date when they are in school or college because they think that their mind withh be distracted and they wont be able to focus on studies. Almost anything can be a distraction from studies. Friends, social media, phycological problems, video games, social media, telivision etc can be as distracting as dating too. Frobiding the kid from dating is not going to permenantly solve the problerm of a distracted mind. The kid should keep in mind that studies and grades have a huge imact in his/her future life and he needs to give more impotace to that so then nothing will distact him or her. My friend and I dated when we were in collage and we get pretty good grades and we never got distracted because we put grades before everything else in life.<br><br>6] nosey and judgmental attitude, people weather its a friend, relative, neighbor, some random stranger sticks their nose into each others business or intervene and sometimes even gossip around the little or big things and some people like to see it as an act of showing love and concern. People expect all Indians to act and think the same way and judge people too quickly and because of this attitude the first thing that comes in his/her mind while making certain life dissisions is what their relatives, friends, neighbors and other people is going to think rather than weather or not the decision is good or bad for them. When a person acts a little crazy, immature or strange on a regular basis people easily assume that he/she has an unsound mind rather than thinking that it is a personality trait.<br><br>7] Sexual repression, our flim industry bollywood makes sex look super vulgar and completely a bad thing. Weather its sex before or after marriage, most people are afraid to even bring that topic up in any way and they fear and lack proper sexual education. Most parents never have the talk with their kids and if they come to know about their kids knowledge about it they freak out. Even joking about sex can be extremely offensive to a lot of people. Sexual education is banned in most schools our dumb minister of health says yoga is more important than this and curious youngsters are getting their minds corrupted or misguided about sexuality trough western tv shows, porn, hip hop, and Hollywood movies etc. They might learn a bit but they don't know the important parts about it about it and they are getting missguided. There are some schools that do teach human reproduction in syllabus but they won't teach us everything about sexuality and the way they teach it isn't that advanced like in the west. They wont properly teach students how to properly use contraceptives and birth control in schools. There is an ancient concept of Kamasutra which is created in India and there are more westerners and less Indians who are more aware about this concept. People are so afraid to even say or hear the word sex.<br><br>8]Conservatism, Indian culture is hardly evolving and some people are so narrow minded and attached to our traditional Indian culture[not that Indian culture is a bad thing,it does have a few pros and was more progressive very long ago] that they don't want to accept any kind of foreign or western influence into India weather its good or bad. some people are so obsessed with the term culture they find culture in almost everything, and some people force their opinions on others, or expect everyone to have the same opinion as them. If an Indian is seen in india speaking english in a western accent or style he gets mocked by some conservative people, he/ she gets called a wannabe American or British.<br><br>example- once at school I had a teacher who was so obsessed with culture she always criticized students for being so westernized in the way they behave ,and once she saw a student chewing gum in class and she forced him to spit it out and said you won't be smart by adopting the western culture. the next time I've seen her catch someone chewing gum she gave a 5 minute speech saying that chewing gum is a filthy western habit and Indians dont need to do this, she was so pissed off that she has even made death threats to him by saying, youre going to get cancer someday for doing this your parents are going to be so sad when you die.[this actually happened its not a made up example].<br><br>9]Lack of unity, there is too much diversity and culture and identity differences between Indians from state to state.<br><br>10] Moral policing in some parts of the country, If a romantic couple is seen on the streets kissing, holding hands or showing feelings of affection in any way they get beaten up by an angry mob of people and get in trouble with the police. and if a teenager is seen dating in public people give really nasty looks and in some parts of india people get really agrassive. some parents get so pissed off when they notice their kids just admiring a beauty the opposite gender when they are not adults.<br><br>11] Religious conflicts in some parts of India like the beef phyasco, groups of people fight and harm people in the name of religion and force their beliefs on others. most of these people are un-educated and our dumb politicians support this kid of stupidity, most of these people taking part in this dont know everything about their own religion or other religions and they just spoil the name of our country.<br><br>12] Giving more importance to money or wealth than mental health and other things in life, Our politicians are more interested in selfishly profiting from our economy than actually developing the country. and also some Indians save money in such a way that they are not living a decent life, some average people lives a life like as if he/he is stuck in poverty, due to over-saving. People brag about the different ways they save money to their friends and family.<br><br>Due to westernization some of the points mentioned differs from person to person or state to state<br><br>No offence to any other Indians reading this<br><br>What is it like being an Indian-American (2nd generation Indian)?<br>I am the poster child of the ABCD (American Born Confused Desi) trope.<br><br>Taking one look at me will tell you everything you need to know about my experience growing up as a South Indian girl in Silicon Valley.<br><br>I have large, visible tattoos, unconventional piercings, bleach blonde hair, grey contacts, I always wear a choker and long acrylic nails, and I love wearing leather and cropped heavy metal tanks. In other words, I am every Indian parent’s nightmare (ok that sounded way more edgy and angsty than I meant for it too, ew). I look absolutely nothing like your stereotypical “good Indian girl”.<br><br>For a long time, whenever people would ask me why I look the way I do, I could never really come up with an answer. I’d usually shrug, smile, and say “ ’Cuz I want to.” Which I guess is, in part, true, but that’s not really the whole reason.<br><br>Even though I grew up in Silicon Valley and went to a school full to the brim with other Indians, I was still bullied a lot growing up. For being Indian, funnily enough. Sure, we were all brown and we all love Jalebi, but to them, I was the wrong kind of Indian. I wasn’t a loud, outgoing North Indian that loved to party. I didn’t come to school every week with different henna patterns adorning my hands. I didn’t have long silky hair with subtle henna highlights. I didn’t know all the words to “Dhoom Machale”, I didn’t know how to dance, and I was extremely shy. My nickname growing up was “Fat Ugly Indian Girl” because I was the wrong type of Indian.<br><br>As you can imagine, having that as my identity to everybody around me hurt. So I tried to prove to everybody that I wasn’t who they said I was and began spending all my effort trying to prove them wrong. I lost weight, I became significantly better looking. But wait, what about that last part? I couldn’t change that. You can’t change your race (sorry, Rachel Dolezal). But you can reject it. Yes, being called Indian isn’t an insult, but it was used as one against me during my most formative years so I saw it as one. So I did everything I possibly could to become as un-Indian as possible. I did everything that the stereotypical good Indian girl would not do. I reveled whenever somebody told me that I’m not really Indian, because Indian girls are shy, modest, they don’t dye their hair or wear edgy clothing or get tattoos. It got to the point where people usually began to think I was mixed, or not even Indian at all. And it felt exhilarating.<br><br>But then, one day while visiting India, my view of myself and my culture began to change. My mom, grandmother and I were visiting a boutique that sold beautiful Indian salwaars and exquisite Indian wedding gowns. I fell in love with those gowns. As small and shallow as it may seem, just seeing those gowns was like a physical shake, telling me to wake up and realize how beautiful my culture is. I stopped viewing my country as dirty and crowded and full of people yelling at me. Sure, there were always crazy amounts of people on the streets, but those were people making beautiful flower garlands, selling watches, ornate sarees, chai, jewelry, everything you could think of. I realized that my country is full of life.<br><br>Over time, I began to chip away at my biases and prejudices that I had built up throughout my life in an effort to feel more accepted. I realized that a lot about my appearance was just me overcompensating and that I was doing a lot to have people see me as American rather than Indian. After all, I didn’t want to be connected to a group whose main representatives in modern day media are characters like Raj Koothrapali and Baljeet from Phineas and Ferb (you know, the whole super nerdy, sweater vest, awkward Indian trope) so I went out of my way to distance myself from that image as much as possible. So now I began to try and reverse the damage.<br><br>In my first year of college, in my Humanities class, we had a unit about India and its fight for independence. For the first time, I was the only Indian in the room, which felt extremely weird as somebody from Cupertino (probably the most Indian city in the world outside of India). All of a sudden, I was the one responsible for keeping accuracies. If my professor or any of my classmates said something incorrect or even prejudiced against my people, I had to stand up because nobody else was gonna do it for me. And the more I did it, the more I talked about my country and my culture with my peers, the more pride I felt. I was, daresay, proud to be Indian. And this newfound pride in my culture helped me even further recognize the ways in which I had attempted to de-Indianify myself in the past.<br><br>I’m not gonna lie though. I still have a long way to go. I’m still trying to learn my language, God knows the only Indian food I can “cook” is a premade naan that I just have to heat up on the stove, I know almost nothing about our music or film industry, and I can keep on listing all the ways in which I need to become more acquainted with my culture. But hey, a huge step has already been taken: I’ve recognized the ways in which my past experiences have led me to repress important aspects of myself and I’m taking steps to reverse that.<br><br>“Cool story, now what’s your point?” you may ask. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure. I guess I just want to bring to light the experience of being Indian American because the only people that really understand anything about it are other Indian Americans. We have virtually no representation in the media. We don’t have a Crazy Rich Asians or Black Panther to show the world that we’re as normal as white people. I spent my entire life trying to do just that, so I feel like now it’s time to let the world know how it feels to grow up being too Desi for Americans and too American for Desis.<br><br>What are the most common traits or habits of Indian youth that you find irritating?<br>The eating manners at Public Places. NO!! I am not talking about eating with hands, that is completely fine and is a part of Indian traditions and culture.<br><br>The most irritating habit is:-<br><br>At street food joints and specially the one offering street food like poha, samosa, kachori, chaat etc. where mostly the food item is served in disposable plates.<br><br>Now after finishing up with eating, 70% people leave their disposable plates at the table only instead of throwing it in the dustbin kept at a hands distance.<br><br><br>Due to the presence of these used plates, other people are not able to use the table till the time shopkeeper notices it and throws it in dustbin.<br><br>The shop owner in fear of backlash and losing a customer never tells people to not to leave the disposable plates at table. I think they should keep a hand written board on table requesting people to throw plates in dustbins..<br><br>I request all people reading this answer to please throw your used disposable plates in dustbins from next time.<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>Why do Indian Americans (citizens from the last decade or two or GC holders) look down upon new Indian immigrants?<br>There is often a crab mentality that affects a lot of human relations.<br><br>Settled Indians often looked down upon “Fresh Off the Boat” Indians.<br>Senior students often rag the incoming students.<br>Mother-in-laws often give unnecessary hardships to the new bride.<br>Every generation thinks the following generation is the spoilt one.<br>The idea behind all of these is that “we have gone through the pain” and it is now time for you to go through the same pain. Humans often get troubled when someone else seems to have it easy when we had to take the hard route.<br><br>The settled Indians don’t give much time or room for the new Indians to assimilate. Assimilation is not an instant process - both the desis who moved earlier and the ones born in the US - took a lot of time to assimilate in their workplaces and gradeschools. The ABDs have to think about the time when they were not the coolest kid in their school. Then empathize with the FOAB.<br><br>To make matters worse, new comers often are way too excited that they don’t act naturally. They sometimes believe just by moving abroad they have achieved something huge. Migration is no big deal - we humans have migrated all the time in our history for our survival. Thus, migrating abroad to work is neither great nor treason - just a plain fact.<br><br>ABD: American Born Desi<br><br>FOAB: Fresh Off the Boat [New Desi]<br><br>Is India losing its culture and tradition?<br>I would be laughed at for following some of the Indian cultures. Not everyone does that but some do.<br><br>Some people laugh at me when they see me with a dhoti.<br>Some people laugh at me if they see me eat in a banana leaf.<br>Some people laugh at me for reading some great old books like Bhagavat Gita, thirukural and so on.<br>Some people laugh at me if they see me coming around tulasi plant every morning.<br>Why should I eat with spoons just because it's a high class restaurant? I'll eat with my hands if I don't feel like eating with spoons.<br>We brush our teeth with chemical toothpaste instead of natural neem sticks.<br>If you're laughing at a person who is doing the above 6 points, then yeah - India is losing its culture and it's tradition.<br><br>Which is better and why: Indian culture or Western culture?<br>I believe that an amalgamation of both is the best way ahead. It's an extremely stupid notion to consider any culture better than the others.<br><br>Sadly as an Indian, I regret to say that this attitude is ceasing to exist in my country. Today's youth considers western culture to be far more superior than our own and consider themselves to be ‘cool’ if they are the westerners in every aspect of life.<br><br>Here are some examples-<br><br>Consider the case of language. Many Indians consider it a shame to speak in their mother tongues. Rather they consider speaking English to be a sign of sophistication and if in today's urban upper class one prefers to talk in an Indian language, he/she is mocked upon and considered to be backward. Can't we just be equally proficient in our mother tongue as well as English? It's so disgusting that we're replacing our culture with the western one rather than assimilating both.<br><br>I love music and dance- both Indian (classical and contemporary) and western but whenever I express my interest in Indian classical music and dance, I get extremely weird looks from my friends. It's so ridiculous that they form an opinion before experiencing the truth.<br><br>A few years back, a classmate of mine at school was asked to perform the role of Goddess Durga in one of the events at annual function. She refused vehemently stating some stupid excuse. But later that day she signed up to act as a modern college going girl in another event. Sadly she wasn't able to do much justice to her role. But she would have made a wonderful Durga(here I'm not telling that Indian culture is better, but shouldn't we consider both to be equal? I'm suggesting that she should have pondered over both the characters and chosen the role that suited her the best)<br><br>And then there's the change in dressing styles. Many people consider a person wearing traditional clothes to be a ‘Behenji/Bhaiya'. He/she is old fashioned according to them. Why can't they realise that Indian and Western wear are just different? None is superior to the other. I wear both Western and Indian with equal gusto and equal frequency. I love them both.(Another thing- a saree doesn't hinder mobility once you get used to it. Or are you suggesting that you're more agile than a Bharatnatyam dancer, or do more physical work than a farmer or a manual labourer?)<br><br>Going to clubs every Friday night is considered to be better than going to temple every Monday. It's such a great thing to remember and be thankful to God atleast once in a while. Why is it such a bad thing according to you? Don't you know that Christians in the west(and also in India too) go to church every Sunday(Muslims in India and abroad also go to mosques every Friday).<br><br>At last I'd like to say that if you're so much influenced by the Western culture, why don't you abide by the values of equality that's so prevalent in the Western culture? Why do you consider someone who has the slightest interest in something Indian to be of a lower status? Such pseudo-western attitude doesn't impress me at all.<br><br>My advice to all Indians would be to give equal importance to both Indian and Western cultures. However we should take a little more pride in our own culture since it is what defines us. Once we lose our unique identity we've nothing else that sets us apart from the rest of the world.<br><br>PS: I'm writing this anonymously since I haven't convinced my friends of my cosmopolitan views. So they might ridicule or even remove me from their friends circle and I don't want that. Once I do, I'll remove my anonymity<br><br>Have a nice day<br><br>What is the biggest culture shock you have ever faced?<br>I married to a Maharashtrian guy about an year ago. It was a love marriage. We had been dating since 1.5 years.<br><br>As a girl from Uttar Pradesh(Mathura), I know the amount of dowry we give to the groom. When my sister was married we gifted the groom a Maruti Suzuki Swift Desire though they had not demanded it. We also gave them cash of ₹ 5,00,000 in dowry. This is not because the groom's family members demand those things. But it's in our blood to gift that to him. Many in UP say that if a girl doesn't take anything to her husband's home, it's a shame to her. All the neighbours shame on her. People tend to believe that there is some problem with guy and so he couldn't fetch enough dowry.<br><br>Having said this, as I broke the news of my boyfriend, my family members first were bit concerned about boy's background. As I come from an upper class, they thought it would be a shame for me to marry a lower class/caste. But fortunately he turned out to be from upper class in Maharashtra and this gave relief to my parents. So they agreed for our marriage. The next thing that came to our mind was dowry. We sat for whole night just to discuss what we should gift the boy. My several uncles and aunts participated in this discussion. Finally the we decided to personally speak with boy's parents if they have any demand concerning this.<br><br>In the meantime, my boyfriend too broke the news to his parents. Though they initially refused to marry him off to a UP girl, he eventually convinced them and we decided to arrange meeting of both families a week later in my home.<br><br>Then came the D-Day. Boy's parents and one of his aunts and uncles showed up in our house. Looking at me they were very happy as I was very well dressed up. After some basic discussions came the point of dowry. Everyone from boys family members refused it. I thought it is casual Indian thing to initially refuse the offerings. They said my parents to just give their daughter to their son with a Mangal Sutra (A sacred necklace they signifies marriage bond) and a coconut. Usually Mangal Sutra is made of gold but they said that if we cannot afford that, a Mangal Sutra made up of black beads may work but they would never accept anything in dowry. They warned us to not even to try to offer it. Otherwise they would break the marriage. This literally shocked us. We tried to explain them our culture of dowry but they were stuck to their principles. Even my boyfriend warned me to not to try ways to present dowry. Finally we had to agree. My family members were first furious over their arrogance over this matter. Many of my uncles and aunts said that there is some defect with the groom and so they behaved like this. Everyone was thinking of what my to be neighbours and family members would say about me for not bringing dowry. But as we were committed, we eventually got married off without any exchange of dowry though my parents gave around 50 grams gold on Mangal Sutra.<br><br>After I came to my husband's home, it was a cultural shock for me to notice that no one asked what I brought from my home. In fact after I discussed with neighbours about what they got from their homes. I got to know that there was only exchange of Mangal Sutra from girl's home. Plus some got costly sarees or some jewelleries from home. But I noticed a thing that whatever they got from their homes was solely for them. That is sarees were used by brides and so were jewellery. They hardly presented a gold ring to groom's home 'for the groom’. There was no exchange of cash, vehicle, property etc. as a part of dowry. I feel proud to be a part of such society now.<br><br>Note: I'm anonymous here because my sister to whom we gave a lot of dowry is active on Quora. As section of IPC 498a criminalises dowry, I don't want to risk anybody's life by providing witnesses to a crime and spoil their happy lives they are living today. I personally feel that those regions who still think dowry is part of their culture need to change a lot.<br><br>Are Indians in general more insecure about our culture? Why is something new always trashed as "aping the west"?<br>of course we are aping the west. There is no doubt about that. But when you talk about Indian culture. What exactly that is ??? Should we wear khadi and dhoti kurta and sarees ? Is that Indian culture ? Does that justify our Culture? Absolutely not. It's not about dressing. It's about getting evolved as per the present times.<br>The biggest flaw in Indian culture is that they don't respect human lives, maybe because there are too many of them. Second largest population in the world. They don't respect animal life. So many!!!<br>Of course who has the time for that!<br>That's the most basic problem<br>W<br><br>India has the richest culture, most of the world took and stole from India.<br><br>Don’t let mainstream city folk in India and bollywood deceive you, those Indians only account for a very low percentage of us! I am Indian Americano but moved to India, I love Indian culture, but I seen for my own eyes how the cities are nothing like the real parts of India!<br><br>In my experience, canadians…….mainly whites and afrikans would get insecure and envious of Indian mens.<br><br>Why do Chinese and Indians seem so insecure?<br>Thanks for this question.<br><br>This is a loaded question. I wonder why you suggest the Chinese and Indians seem insecure.<br><br>At the very start, China and India have raced up the economic charts with China heading the list and India just below. Please see how India will overtake the USA in another decade.<br><br>India will overtake the US economy by 2030<br><br>India's GDP expected to grow at 7.3% in 2018-19<br><br>Unfortunately, the Americans are now rated with 50% in poverty. If at all any insecurity surfaces it will be the one great country that is down on its knees at the current time. Things have gotten worse in the last 2 years!<br><br>Income and Poverty in the United States: 2017<br><br>GDP forecasts over the next decade place India and China at the top tier. This is a clear definition of security.<br><br>worlds leading economies 2019<br><br>Where does insecurity come into this? I'm surprised that such a statement even makes any sense.<br><br>Two nations battling it out on the worlds stage with progressive policies placing them at the top tier does not cause insecurity at all. Jobs are being created, goods and services have reached global upmarket standards, the disposable dollar has climbed steadily, the middle class has doubled itself and security on every front is now guaranteed. Stable and forward-thinking governments have changed the way people think and the peace in both regions is palpable.<br><br>If at all, there is any visible insecurity it will be created by obsessed neighbors and old colonial countries unable to keep the same relentless pace of growth.<br><br>Even for a brief second, I don't believe these two countries seem insecure.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Should Indians be proud of their culture?<br>I read the most upvoted answer to tois question and then formed a small opinion regarding this question.<br><br>In the most upvoted answer, OP has written that how vermillion aka “SINDOOR” is a part of Indian culture. Is it the eternal part of Indian culture??<br><br>Let's explore!!<br><br>I am from the Telugu community, my great grandmother never applied vermillion in her “Maang” meaning head. Sindoor is traditionally never a custom in the Telgu community like in the north Indian community.<br><br>The Marathi Brahmin also never used to apply sindoor on their head. You can observe in the movie Bajirao Mastani, that Kashi Bai played by Priyanka Chopra never applies Sindoor on her head. The tradition of applying Sindoor on the head was never followed by the community of Peshwas.<br><br><br>Let's travel to Karnataka, if you observe the painting of the Queens of Mysore, here you do not find any trace of Sindoor on their heads. Sindoor was and still is not a tradition in Kannadigas.<br><br><br>Let's travel to the most neglected part of India, “NORTH EAST.”<br><br>I had a friend who belonged to the Kooki community of Manipur, her family belonged to the Hindu religion, but her mother never applied sindoor because it was not in their tradition.<br><br><br>Tribals of Chattisgarh do not apply sindoor.<br><br>There are many parts of India where we can observe a drastic change from marriage customs to lifestyle, that's the diversity of India. Coming back to the question?<br><br>So is “SINDOOR” an eternal part of Indian culture?<br>Absolutely not, because Indian culture does not belong to only the “North Indian, Hindi speaking belt” it belongs to all the communities who have come together to make this nation.<br>If my community does not has the tradition of “SINDOOR” does that mean it's not a part of Indian culture?<br>Not. We all have different traditions and cucultures if our culture does not belong to the culture of the majority of populated ones, that doesn't mean our culture does not belong to the nation or our culture is wrong in any kind of way.<br>For example, North Indians celebrate Saraswati Puja by paying respect and worshipping her, but Assamese people on that day enjoy the festival by eating pork.<br><br>Amazing right!!<br><br>That's the beauty of India, is that it's intensely diverse and holistic. We can't reduce it to only one factor, culture or language.<br><br>What is culture?<br>Its the binding force between the people, it is the way of life with pomp and happiness, it is the way of living together with humility and humanity, iits way of celebrating life with the interdependence of natural entities.<br><br>Do not consider culture as a way of branding. Culture includes lifestyle, art, philosophy, literature,, and humanity as it's base not its aim for segregation.<br><br>For example, I had a best friend back in my school, she was quite interested in the cultural arts of India. So she learned a lot of cultural paintings across the nation to learn about the culture of this country. She knew the rare art painting of South India where the portraits of God are painted with colors that have traces of gold in them.<br><br>This is the culture of India driven by arts and philosophy.<br><br>Celebrate culture with confidence,, not pride. Also do not follow any patriarchal or inhuman practices in name of culture, because our culture gives us the courage to question things and to change with times and discard traditions that bring sorrow and inferiority to people's lives.<br><br>SHOULD INDIANS BE PROUD OF THEIR CULTURE??<br><br>Yes, they should be not just of their communities but of the entire nation without any judgmental thoughts. Let our acceptance be of diverse cultures of our country as well.<br><br><br>QUE SERA SERA.<br><br>Why don't Indians value their own culture?<br>India have a Railway station named after the invader who destroyed the Nalanda University.<br><br><br>The leftist historians have glorified invaders and made Indians as backward in their own history.<br><br>Anugrhitoasmi 💛<br><br>What are Indians most insecure about?<br>Their parents from finding out the content in c:/Users/<your-name>/Documents/Important Study/Materials/Programming/Java folder<br><br>What is life like as an Indian-American teenager living in the United States?<br>For me, it’s been terrible. What Annu Iyer said in her answer is completely true. BTW, my parents are Punjabi.<br><br>Growing up, in elementary and middle school I was never allowed to go see friends or do anything after school or on weekends. My parents were afraid I’d acquire bad habits from other children. Never was I allowed to participate in any after school activity or sports either. The only socialization I got was during school hours.<br><br>In 9th grade I got pulled out of school and started homeschooling because my parents were afraid I would get too Americanized if I were exposed to an American highschool. I didn’t get any opportunity to socialize with anyone after that. What little socialization I did get was from sneaking online and talking to people over the Internet behind my parents’ backs.<br><br>Later on, I wasn’t allowed to go to college and I was forced into a tech career by my dad with a made up resume. In their eyes, why waste money on college if you can just lie and take a shortcut. By this point though, I was extremely socially awkward and could barely speak to anyone normally. On my first job interview, I was a stuttering, nervous wreck. I was fortunate enough to have gotten the job because the hiring manager liked my personality and trusted me, despite my shortcomings. No one checked my employment history or degree.<br><br>That being said, my parents still treat me as though I am 12. They decide what I do 24/7, except for the time I am at work. My parents bought some fixer upper properties and we spend all our free time working on those. I have never in my life hung out with friends, gone to a party, or done anything on my own. I have no control over the money I earn from my job.<br><br>Going to family events is extremely stressful. My parents try to show me off to my relatives as if I am some kind of pet theirs trained to do tricks. They constantly brag how they have made me earning over $120K at such a young age. They have me lie to my relatives that I went to college. When my relatives ask me follow up questions about my college, I don’t know what to say.<br><br>The part that really gets to me is this: My parents are constantly angry with me because I am not happy, and consider me as a spoiled, ungrateful brat who was handed everything to him on a silver platter. My dad tells me constantly that given my level of intelligence, I would be nothing without him. I would have been working at McDonalds at this time, while attending college part time and doing drugs, had he not taken action and “saved” me from this “dirty” American culture. And that if anyone else were in my position, they would be thanking him every day for giving them such an opportunity.<br><br>I’m kind of stuck now. I can’t leave home because I have financial obligations that my parents forced me into (home mortgage).<br><br>This ridiculous behavior all stems from the outdated Indian mentality that your children are not individuals. Rather, they are little puppets that you control and mold the way you want.<br><br>I now have zero respect for Indian people, culture, and traditions and the entire country itself. Some may tell me that my parents are exceptions, and situations like mine are uncommon and do not represent Indian culture, but I refuse to believe that.<br><br>Are Indians insecure? Or proud? Or nationalistic? Or simply not exposed?<br>Indians are all of these, and a lot more.<br><br>Specifically on Quora, a large crowd of Indians is young, studying/working, and connecting to the world so meaningfully for the first time. These are youngsters who were born or were kids when the Indian economy opened up. They have grown up in the times of fresh globalisation, the beginning of the Internet and cellphone revolution (in India), and the first few years of India's unprecedented contact with global trends and culture.<br><br>These are youngsters who identify more with their counterparts in another country and culture, than with their own grandparents. The keenness in establishing this similarity, in giving and receiving feedback over the same, and in creating one's place in the global fusion in the process is natural. They also happen to have various outlets for expressing this keenness, and Quora is one of them.<br><br>Yes, they are less-exposed, but they are also eager to know more. They seek knowledge and information, just as they seek approval and validation. They are a mix of what their elders, schools and societies have taught them, and what global exposure is teaching them. They are able to balance seemingly contradictory attitudes of nationalism and self-criticism; for them, their need not be any contradiction between the two at all.<br><br>It is age, a blend of cultures and the unprecedented availability of outlets that is concocting such a result, especially on Quora. It has both positives and negatives to it, but if you look at it from the culture-social-economic-technological-demographic point of view, you will see that it is only natural. It would be interesting to see how content on Quora changes as the current Indian crowd here ages, and new members get added. The content they generate would reflect a changing reality of India.<br><br>Why are Indians serious, insecure, and in a rush to do everything?<br>Firstly, I don't think you need to be anonymous about this. This is a perfectly legit question.<br><br>Why are Indians serious? Well, Indians are generally serious because there are a lot of things going on in their lives. The people around them are generally very intrusive and judgmental, which doesn't help. That said, I think Indians are jovial and comfortable around people they like and care about.<br><br>Why are Indians insecure? I don't think it is insecurity. Its just that we are not great at having conversations. We don't usually speak to people unless its necessary. That's the way it works in India. Again, this holds good for a majority but NOT ALL Indians.<br><br>Why are Indians in a rush? Well, that's the way our society works. There are so many people and everyone has so much to do. Our society doesn't expect us to smile at or greet or thank other people unless there is something very substantial going on there. This is very normal in India. And once we are accustomed to this for decades, it kind of sticks. That said, we do embrace other cultures and societies. We try to gel in and behave accordingly.<br><br>About YouTube/ Facebook/ Forum comments being filled with hate, that mentality is not limited to Indians. Its mob mentality and is observed with people from all countries. Its an internet problem in general. I am not a part of it, neither do I endorse it.<br><br>Why are indians so ashamed of their own culture and mad about anything foreign?<br>A friend has recently forwarded me a quote from Lord Macaulay's speech in the British Parliament on 2nd February 1835. I reproduce the quote below:<br><br>"I have traveled across the length and breadth of India and I have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief. Such wealth I have seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such calibre, that I do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the very backbone of this nation, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and, therefore, I propose that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own, they will lose their self-esteem, their native self-culture and they will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation."<br><br>There is no authoritative source for this quote, except Hindu Nationalist magazines and sources, though this is widely circulated and believed.<br><br>But I cannot help but see that this would clearly help Britisher's motive of using India as a market for their goods. Even if we assume this quote as a fraud, 'Gora bola sahi bola' attitude is still deeply instilled in the people.<br><br>We can learn a thing from our tibetan neighbours as to how to respect and preserve one's culture and heritage; it is never too late to acknowledge our roots.<br><br>What are the disadvantages of Indian culture?<br>The things that I hate about Indian culture:<br><br>Extreme patriarchy : Any sane person would agree that patriarchy is a big part of Indian culture. The entire foundation of Indian society is based on fixed gender roles, which kept getting worse with times. Women get tortured, harassed and judged at the hands of patriarchy every single day; but we somehow still live with this. We do not protest and fight enough against this. The elders find the topic of gender equality totally absurd. Many of us do not ubderstand what absolute gebder equality means. For most Indians, allowing a woman to get educated<br>Do people from other nations feels insecure because of the presence of Indians in every field? If yes, then why is it so?<br>I’m from the US, and I don’t feel the slightest insecurity about the success of Indians in many fields. People who are intelligent and work hard deserve to succeed, regardless of what country they were born in. It’s people that matter, not nationalities.<br><br>Why are people from India so much nicer and more polite than many other cultures?<br>The reason for this can be our cultural upbringing:<br>We have grown in a collectivist culture unlike other countries that support individualism .<br>(Collectivist cultures emphasize the needs and goals of the group as a whole over the needs and desires of each individual. In such cultures, relationships with other members of the group and the interconnectedness between people play a central role in each person's identity.<br><br>Individualistic culture is a society which is characterized by individualism, which is the prioritization or emphasis of the individual over the entire group.

Power Distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally.<br><br>India scores high on this dimension, 77, indicating an appreciation for hierarchy and a top-down structure in society and organizations. If one were to encapsulate the Indian attitude, one could use the following words and phrases : dependent on the boss or the power holder for direction, acceptance of un-equal rights between the power-privileged and those who are lesser down in the pecking order, immediate superiors accessible but one layer above less so, paternalistic leader, management directs, gives reason / meaning to ones work life and rewards in exchange for loyalty from employees. Real Power is centralized even though it may not appear to be and managers count on the obedience of their team members. Employees expect to be directed clearly as to their functions and what is expected of them. Control is familiar, even a psychological security, and attitude towards managers are formal even if one is on first name basis. Communication is top down and directive in its style and often feedback which is negative is never offered up the ladder.<br><br>Individualism<br><br>The fundamental issue addressed by this dimension is the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members. It has to do with whether people´s self-image is defined in terms of “I” or “We”. In Individualist societies people are supposed to look after themselves and their direct family only. In Collectivist societies people belong to ‘in groups’ that take care of them in exchange for loyalty.<br><br>India, with a rather intermediate score of 48, is a society with both collectivistic and Individualist traits. The collectivist side means that there is a high preference for belonging to a larger social framework in which individuals are expected to act in accordance to the greater good of one’s defined in-group(s). In such situations, the actions of the individual are influenced by various concepts such as the opinion of one’s family, extended family, neighbours, work group and other such wider social networks that one has some affiliation toward. For a collectivist,to be rejected by one’s peers or to be thought lowly of by one’s extended and immediate in-groups, leaves him or her rudderless and with a sense of intense emptiness. The employer/employee relationship is one of expectations based on expectations – Loyalty by the employee and almost familial protection by the Employer. Hiring and promotion decisions are often made based on relationships which are the key to everything in a Collectivist society.<br><br>The Individualist aspect of Indian society is seen as a result of its dominant religion/philosophy - Hinduism. The Hindus believe in a cycle of death and rebirth, with the manner of each rebirth being dependent upon how the individual lived the preceding life. People are, therefore, individually responsible for the way they lead their lives and the impact it will have upon their rebirth. This focus on individualism interacts with the otherwise collectivist tendencies of the Indian society which leads to its intermediate score on this dimension.<br><br>Masculinity<br><br>A high score (Masculine) on this dimension indicates that the society will be driven by competition, achievement and success, with success being defined by the winner / best in field – a value system that starts in school and continues throughout organisational life.<br><br>A low score (Feminine) on the dimension means that the dominant values in society are caring for others and quality of life. A Feminine society is one where quality of life is the sign of success and standing out from the crowd is not admirable. The fundamental issue here is what motivates people, wanting to be the best (Masculine) or liking what you do (Feminine).<br><br>India scores 56 on this dimension and is thus considered a Masculine society. India is actually very Masculine in terms of visual display of success and power. The designer brand label, the flash and ostentation that goes with advertising one’s success, is widely practiced.However, India is also a spiritual country with millions of deities and various religious philosophies. It is also an ancient country with one of the longest surviving cultures which gives it ample lessons in the value of humility and abstinence. This often reigns in people from indulging in Masculine displays to the extent that they might be naturally inclined to. In more Masculine countries the focus is on success and achievements, validated by material gains. Work is the center of one’s life and visible symbols of success in the work place are ery important.<br><br>Uncertainty Avoidance<br><br>The dimension Uncertainty Avoidance has to do with the way that a society deals with the fact that the future can never be known: should we try to control the future or just let it happen? This ambiguity brings with it anxiety and different cultures have learnt to deal with this anxiety in different ways. The extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these is reflected in the score on Uncertainty Avoidance.<br><br>India scores 40 on this dimension and thus has a medium low preference for avoiding uncertainty. In India, there is acceptance of imperfection; nothing has to be perfect nor has to go exactly as planned. India is traditionally a patient country where tolerance for the unexpected is high ; even welcomed as a break from monotony. People generally do not feel driven and compelled to take action-initiatives and comfortably settle into established rolls and routines without questioning. Rules are often in place just to be circumvented and one relies on innovative methods to “bypass the system”. A word used often is “adjust” and means a wide range of things, from turning a blind eye torules being flouted to finding a unique and inventive solution to a seemingly insurmountable problem. It is this attitude that is both the cause of misery as well as the most empowering aspect of the country. There is a saying that “nothing is impossible” in India, so long as one knows how to “adjust”.<br><br>Long Term Orientation<br><br>This dimension describes how every society has to maintain some links with its own past while dealing with the challenges of the present and future, and societies prioritise these two existential goals differently. Normative societies. which score low on this dimension, for example, prefer to maintain time-honoured traditions and norms while viewing societal change with suspicion. Those with a culture which scores high, on the other hand, take a more pragmatic approach: they encourage thrift and efforts in modern education as a way to prepare for the future.<br><br>With an intermediate score of 51 in this dimension, a dominant preference in Indian culture cannot be determined. In India the concept of“karma” dominates religious and philosophical thought. Time is not linear, and thus is not as important as to western societies which typically score low on this dimension. Countries like India have a great tolerance for religious views from all over the world. Hinduism is often considered a philosophy more than even a religion; an amalgamation of ideas, views, practices and esoteric beliefs. In India there is an acceptance that there are many truths and often depends on the seeker. Societies that have a high score on pragmatism typically forgive a lack of punctuality, a changing game-plan based on changing reality and a general comfort with discovering the fated path as one goes along rather than playing to an exact plan.<br><br>Indulgence<br><br>One challenge that confronts humanity, now and in the past, is the degree to which small children are socialized. Without socialization we do not become “human”. This dimension is defined as the extent to which people try to control their desires and impulses, based on the way they were raised. Relatively weak control is called “Indulgence” and relatively strong control is called “Restraint”. Cultures can, therefore, be described as Indulgent or Restrained.<br><br>India receives a low score of 26 in this dimension, meaning that it is a culture of Restraint. Societies with a low score in this dimension have a tendency to cynicism and pessimism. Also, in contrast to Indulgent societies, Restrained societies do not put much emphasis on leisure time and control the gratification of their desires. People with this orientation have the perception that their actions are Restrained by social norms and feel that indulging themselves is somewhat wrong.<br><br>UNITED STATES:<br><br>If we explore the US culture through the lens of the 6-D Model, we can get a good overview of the deep driving factors of American culture relative to other cultures in our world. By supplying you with this information please realise that culture describes a central tendency in society. Everybody is unique, yet social control ensures that most people will not deviate too much from the norm. Moreover, within every country regional cultural differences exist, also in the States. Americans, however, don’t need to go to a cultural briefing before moving to another state successfully.<br><br>Power Distance<br><br>The fact that everybody is unique implies that we are all unequal. One of the most salient aspects of inequality is the degree of power each person exerts or can exert over other persons; power being defined as the degree to which a person is able to influence other people’s ideas and behavior.<br><br>This dimension deals with the fact that all individuals in societies are not equal, and it expresses the attitude of the culture toward these power inequalities amongst us. Power distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally. It has to do with the fact that a society’s inequality is endorsed by the followers as much as by the leaders.<br><br>Individualism<br><br>The fundamental issue addressed by this dimension is the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members. It has to do with whether people´s self-image is defined in terms of “I” or “We”. In Individualist societies people are only supposed to look after themselves and their direct family. In Collectivist societies people belong to “in groups” that take care of them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.<br><br>The fairly low score on Power Distance(40) in combination with one of the the most Individualist (91) cultures in the world reflects itself in the following:<br><br>The American premise of “liberty and justice for all.” This is evidenced by an explicit emphasis on equal rights in all aspects of American society and government.<br>Within American organisations, hierarchy is established for convenience, superiors are accessible and managers rely on individual employees and teams for their expertise.<br>Both managers and employees expect to be consulted and information is shared frequently. At the same time, communication is informal, direct and participative to a degree.<br>The society is loosely-knit in which the expectation is that people look after themselves and their immediate families only and should not rely (too much) on authorities for support.<br>There is also a high degree of geographical mobility in the United States. Americans are the best joiners in the world; however it is often difficult, especially among men, to develop deep friendships.<br>Americans are accustomed to doing business or interacting with people they don’t know well. Consequently, Americans are not shy about approaching their prospective counterparts in order to obtain or seek information. In the business world, employees are expected to be self-reliant and display initiative. Also, within the exchange-based world of work we see that hiring, promotion and decisions are based on merit or evidence of what one has done or can do.<br>Masculinity<br><br>A high score (Masculine) on this dimension indicates that the society will be driven by competition, achievement and success, with success being defined by the “winner” or “best-in-the-field”. This value system starts in childhood and continues throughout one’s life – both in work and leisure pursuits.<br><br>A low score (Feminine) on the dimension means that the dominant values in society are caring for others and quality of life. A Feminine society is one where quality of life is the sign of success and standing out from the crowd is not admirable. The fundamental issue here is what motivates people, wanting to be the best (Masculine) or liking what you do (Feminine).<br><br>The score of the US on Masculinity is high at 62, and this can be seen in the typical American behavioral patterns. This can be explained by the the combination of a high Masculinity drive together with the most Individualist drive in the world. In other words, Americans, so to speak, all show their Masculine drive individually. The British, however, have the same culture in this respect. The question, therefore, should be: is the same drive not normally to be seen on the surface? This difference is a reflection of the higher score of the US on Uncertainty Avoidance than of the UK. In other words, in both societies we find the same drive, but Americans show it up-front whereas the British will take you by surprise.<br><br>This American combination reflects itself in the following:<br><br>Behavior in school, work, and play are based on the shared values that people should “strive to be the best they can be” and that “the winner takes all”. As a result, Americans will tend to display and talk freely about their “successes” and achievements in life. Being successful per se is not the great motivator in American society, but being able to show one’s success<br>Many American assessment systems are based on precise target setting, by which American employees can show how well a job they did.<br>There exists a “can-do” mentality which creates a lot of dynamism in the society, as it is believed that there is always the possibility to do things in a better way<br>Typically, Americans “live to work” so that they can obtain monetary rewards and as a consequence attain higher status based on how good one can be. Many white collar workers will move to a more fancy neighborhood after each and every substantial promotion.<br>It is believed that a certain degree of conflict will bring out the best of people, as it is the goal to be “the winner”. As a consequence, we see a lot of polarisation and court cases. This mentality nowadays undermines the American premise of “liberty and justice for all.” Rising inequality is endangering democracy, because a widening gap among the classes may slowly push Power Distance up and Individualism down.<br>Uncertainty Avoidance<br><br>The dimension Uncertainty Avoidance has to do with the way that a society deals with the fact that the future can never be known: should we try to control the future or just let it happen? This ambiguity brings with it anxiety and different cultures have learnt to deal with this anxiety in different ways. The extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these is reflected in the score on Uncertainty Avoidance.<br><br>The US scores below average, with a low score of 46, on the Uncertainty Avoidance dimension. . As a consequence, the perceived context in which Americans find themselves will impact their behaviour more than if the culture would have either scored higher or lower. Thus, this cultural pattern reflects itself as follows:<br><br>There is a fair degree of acceptance for new ideas, innovative products and a willingness to try something new or different, whether it pertains to technology, business practices or food. Americans tend to be more tolerant of ideas or opinions from anyone and allow the freedom of expression. At the same time, Americans do not require a lot of rules and are less emotionally expressive than higher-scoring cultures.<br>At the same time, 9/11 has created a lot of fear in the American society culminating in the efforts of government to monitor everybody through the NSA and other security organisations<br>Long Term Orientation<br><br>This dimension describes how every society has to maintain some links with its own past while dealing with the challenges of the present and future, and societies prioritise these two existential goals differently. Normative societies. which score low on this dimension, for example, prefer to maintain time-honoured traditions and norms while viewing societal change with suspicion. Those with a culture which scores high, on the other hand, take a more pragmatic approach: they encourage thrift and efforts in modern education as a way to prepare for the future.<br><br>The United States scores normative on the fifth dimension with a low score of 26. This is reflected by the following:<br><br>Americans are prone to analyse new information to check whether it is true. Thus, the culture doesn’t make most Americans pragmatic, but this should not be confused with the fact that Americans are very practical, being reflected by the “can-do” mentallity mentioned above.<br>The polarisation mentioned above is, so to speak, strengthened by the fact that many Americans have very strong ideas about what is “good” and “evil”. This may concern issues such as abortion, use of drugs, euthanasia, weapons or the size and rights of the government versus the States and versus citizens.<br>The US is the one of the only “Caucasian” countries in the world where, since the beginning of the 20th century, visiting church has increased. This increase is also evident in some post-Soviet republics such as Russia.<br>American businesses measure their performance on a short-term basis, with profit and loss statements being issued on a quarterly basis. This also drives individuals to strive for quick results within the work place.<br>Indulgence<br><br>One challenge that confronts humanity, now and in the past, is the degree to which small children are socialised. Without socialisation we do not become “human”. This dimension is defined as the extent to which people try to control their desires and impulses, based on the way they were raised. A tendency toward a relatively weak control over their impulses is called “Indulgence”, whereas a relatively strong control over their urges is called “Restraint”. Cultures can be described as Indulgent or Restrained.<br><br>The United States scores as an Indulgent (68) society on the sixth dimension. This, in combination with a normative score, is reflected by the following contradictory attitudes and behaviour:<br><br>Work hard and play hard.<br>The States has waged a war against drugs and is still very busy in doing so, yet drug addiction in the States is higher than in many other wealthy countries.<br>It is a prudish society yet even some well-known televangelists appear to be immoral.<br>Likewise, people from different countries have different behavioral and emotional attributes in compare to Indians and these attributes are highly influence by their culture and customs. When we have no knowledge about the culture and customs of people from other countries we fail to understand them and try to be biased and judgemental. This also leads to communication gap and lack of cooperation.<br><br>Food for thought: These 6 dimensions are the standard ones which can lead to many more…..<br><br>(Source: Geert Hofstede - Geert Hofstede)<br><br>Is Indian culture better than American culture?<br>No, I don't think Indian culture is better than western culture.<br>There are lots of superstitions in Indian culture.<br><br>Dowry is an Indian culture.<br>Indian culture creates lots of differences between a man and woman.<br>Its Indian culture which leads to rape.<br>Women are always guilty in our Indian culture.<br>In Indian culture, we are proud of Krishna- Radha love, but if someone in a family or neighbour love someone, all of them go against them.<br><br>In Indian culture, people are discriminated on the basis of their caste.

I had a feeling that someone was going to ask me expand on this, and now I'm finding it hard to actually do so. But I'll give it a shot. Again, just as a disclaimer, I can only speak from my own experiences and what I've observed of others.<br><br>So I can't possibly provide a comprehensive account of what it means to be Indian-American (an experience that is by no means universally defined), but I want to cover at least a few issues:<br><br>Culture clash<br>Individualism<br>Religion<br>Gender<br>Identity<br><br>* Please no one flame me for my views. If you disagree with my comments, remember that I'm only expressing what I've witnessed and experienced, and feel free to write your own answer if your experiences differ.<br><br>The issues here are both temporal (generational, tradition vs. modernity) and spatial (geography, environment). Second generation Indian-Americans are Indian and American, with one foot in each world. There are ways in which Indians tend to assimilate easily (professionally, linguistically) and less easily (politically, religiously). The world "bicultural" has been thrown around to describe these people, which is accurate, but not as simple as it sounds. Indian and American cultures don't come together neatly in every way, and even as someone that confronts both Indian and American culture in everyday life, I find that I, more or less subconsciously, try to compartmentalize those two parts of my identity rather than integrate them.<br><br>A lot of Indian-Americans I know resolve this problem by separating the private sphere, where they can be "Indian" (religion, social life, culture) and the public sphere, where they are "American" (business, politics, different aspects of culture). Have I been called a "coconut"? Sure. But most of my white acquaintances know very little about me as an Indian, aside from the model minority and perpetual foreigner stereotypes. And that's fine, they shouldn't have to care about my being Indian all the time...but will they ever really know me without knowing the Indian half of my identity?<br><br>So here's a little about me: I'm a (sometimes) practicing Jain, and a vegetarian. I don't really watch Bollywood movies and have no opinion about SRK. I don't care for cricket, but then I don't really care for most sports. I don't plan to become a doctor or engineer, but I am having a bit of a crisis about what I should do to meet my parents' expectations about income and education and save face in their community. I like Indian clothes and opportunities to dress up. I like Indian weddings in general, but find the ceremonies very boring because I don't speak Hindi. I don't drink, not for religious reasons but because I don't want to. I'm one of the few Indian-American women I know that has never taken classical dance lessons. I'm generally a high achieving student (not to brag).<br><br>And that's only my case. Just one person, of the hundreds of thousands of Indian-Americans. And it's not even all of me. I don't think I fit all that easily into models of what Americans conceptualize as "Indian" or what Indians conceptualize as "American". I'm just me.<br><br>As a woman, Indian-American identity can be even more difficult to negotiate, because women are often expected to be a protectors and defenders of Indian culture--traditional, religious, modest, even submissive. I'm fortunate enough to have a relatively progressive family and community, and I rarely encounter outright sexism, but I still experience it subtly on both the "American" and "Indian" fronts. Women are treated as a nurturers, caretakers, and responsible for housework and children on top of working part- or full-time. (This is true in the United States as well, but the attitude is far stronger among first generation immigrants from India.) Second generation girls and women experience the cultural battle more potently than anyone, as they have been raised in a public sphere that experienced Second Wave feminism, and simultaneously raised in a private sphere where they are expected to embody traditional Indian femininity. Many Indian women are not independents, they are extensions of their husbands--or at least, that's the public mask they wear, even if they wear the pants in private. As an American that values feminism and individualism, this sits very uncomfortably with me. (I don't mean to imply that Indian women are passive--my mom would bite any man's head off any day--but even she still adheres to some very old-world gender roles.)<br><br>American individualism and Indian communitarianism (terms used broadly and loosely here) come into conflict in other ways as well. For example, in the pressure that many Indian-American children face in school, and high expectations that extend to career choices, which pretty much come down to doctor, engineer, lawyer, or businessperson. Aside from their professional lives, many (not necessarily most or all) Indian-Americans face pressure in their personal lives as well. No dating. No premarital sex. No BMWs (blacks, whites, or Muslims, geddit?). I'm sure that some of the more conservative groups still practice arranged marriage. (My parents joke about that frighteningly often.) It's no secret that Indians value wealth, education, and religion--perhaps to an unhealthy degree, at times--and those are the qualities they (or their parents) often seek in potential spouses. And sometimes, when you want to make an independent choice, you get written off as a child that doesn't know better, or an ABCD (American-Born Confused Desi).<br><br>While in most cases, parents aren't as dominant or heavy-handed as you see in the movies, there's still this wormy, constraining expectation that's almost as bad. You rarely fear that your parents will hate you or disown you for choosing your own path, professionally or personally. Instead, you worry that you will upset them, disappoint them, that you will lose face in the community, that your parents will be ashamed of you when their friends talk about how their kids are going to Harvard Medical School while you're earning a fine arts degree in a prestigious program that no Indian has ever heard of. Sometimes you feel like you lack opportunities to develop your own hobbies, interests, and passions because you're so convinced on a fundamental level that what your parents want is what you want. I fought with myself quite a bit upon deciding to pursue a pair of social science degrees, and I consider myself to be one of the more independent Indians I know! But some Indian-Americans lead lives of delusion, having convinced themselves that they really, truly want to be doctors or engineers when it's plain as day to anyone else that they don't. It may seem simple for a lot of Americans to say "Just follow your dreams!" or "It's your life!" but it's not that simple for me.<br><br>Of course, the pressure isn't entirely one-sided. In the United States, there is a historical culture of assimilation (melting pot?), and "Welcome to America" has usually carried the unmentioned connotation of "Leave your cultural baggage at the door!" In order to fit in, to be treated as "normal" and as a cultural peer and equal, I have to "act white" in public, and when I don't act white enough, I get called out on it. This happens most often in reference to religion, wherein I feel like my religious views are purposefully misunderstood and misrepresented by many Americans, Christians and atheists alike. (Even the one paragraph about Jainism that you find in AP World History textbooks is horrifyingly inaccurate.) Don't get me wrong, most people are nice enough, or at least nice enough not ask invasive questions or make personal attacks, but it would be a lie to say that I've never been the recipient of stupid and bigoted comments. When I was in sixth grade, a few months after 9/11, a classmate accused me of being a terrorist because I didn't support President Bush. I can't imagine that very many white people know how that feels.<br><br>(I'm going to stop here for now because I need to work on my finals, but I'll expand and edit more when I have the time! I'll add more positive stuff too, because right now it sounds like being Indian-American sucks.)<br>-----<br><br>So basically, as an Indian-American, you have all kinds of balls in the air: race, religion, class/caste (which I didn't discuss), gender, nationality, career...And you have to juggle them. Sometimes you let a ball drop because you can't put the rest of your life, your dreams, your passions on hold to keep it up in the air. You feel terrible about it. You feel like you've let down your parents, your community, your nationality. It distracts you from the other balls, but you have to keep going, and try desperately to keep the rest of the balls up in the air. Most often, in time, you find a balance. You learn to get the hang of it, even if it means performing Indian-ness or American-ness at times.<br><br>Also, I found online the survey results of a study done by Boston University about some of their Indian-American students. Maybe the numbers will shed more light on the issue that I haven't manage qualitatively:<br>http://people.bu.edu/prothero/survey1.html<br><br>This thread on Reddit reveals some experiences of racism and sexism within the Indian community that are very different from mine: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/moxu7/iama_east_indian_girl_who_was_disowned_by_her/<br><br>What are 3 things that you love about Indian culture?<br>A2A<br><br>The concept of Atithi Devo Bhava.

But atleast have some respect for food.<br><br>And by the way there is a difference between lungi and mundu, just incase you didnt know.<br><br><br>🙌<br><br>What is Indian culture? What do you actually mean by that?<br>I got a call from the police station.<br><br>The SI on the other end:<br><br>“Hi! There is a Person in our office and he needs your help.”<br><br>Me, “What happened?”<br><br>The SI said, “Well! There is a snake in his house.”<br><br>Me, “OK! I will be there in 10–15 min.”<br><br>As the police station is close to my house. I quickly went there.<br><br>I met the man and SI and asked the person to take me to his home.<br><br>I was riding the bike, with him sitting on the pillion seat.<br><br>After a while with some hesitation, He said,<br><br>“Sir! I am roaming here and there for two hours. Thus finally I went to the police station.”<br><br>I asked him why he didn’t call anybody.<br><br>On which he said, “Sir! I had a diary in which I wrote numbers. But it is lost now.”<br><br>As soon as this conversation end, we reached the spot.<br><br>He had a typical Indian rural house with thatched roof and mud walls. The person was a labourer and was meeting his ends on daily wages.<br><br>His family was sitting outside the house and as soon as they saw me, they were a bit relaxed.<br><br>I asked them, “Where is the snake?”<br><br>And they pointed me towards a small extension of the house.<br><br>And, As soon as I entered the extension, I saw a very appalling scene.<br><br>Two chicks of hen were dead with tiny drops of blood around them and a rooster was lying unconscious in a box.<br><br>I asked them to describe the snake and my guess was right.<br><br>The culprit of this horrible scene was this snake:<br><br><br>image source: Youtube<br><br>A Spectacled Cobra.<br><br>I searched here and there, and it was an unsuccessful attempt. The snake was gone.<br><br>At this point, you must be thinking,<br><br>‘How does it answer the question?’<br><br>Well! If you have read carefully:<br><br>He is a labourer working on daily wage.<br>Losing 3 hens might not seem too much, but for a person like him, it’s a huge toll.<br>Plus, emotional trauma can’t be measure. I mean he saw the snake killing chicks, which many people treat like babies.<br>At this point,<br><br>You must be thinking<br><br>Why didn’t he kill the snake?<br><br>To which I would like to quote the man himself. He said while I was searching the snake:<br><br>We don’t want to do the sin of killing a living being<br><br>I mean Imagine,<br><br>A living being did harm to him in some way. Still, that person wanted to follow the path of peace and search for help for two hours.<br>He wanted me to rescue and rehabilitate the snake in the wild. That means he showed respect to the living being.<br>And I think,<br><br>This is what Indian culture is all about. We believe in peace and we respect each living being and that’s what makes us special.<br><br>PS: Spectacled Cobra is not a Villain here. They don’t kill anyone for fun or to seek revenge, They do it to keep themselves alive.<br><br>Why can't people in India be as open minded as people in foreign countries?<br>India and Indian was like europe in the past, but islamic invasion made it conservative, not only india but what we see in southern asia is mostly influenced by islamic cultural.<br><br>For example a group of people living somewhere, they don't have problem when couple hugs or kiss in public places, don't have problem girls show their skin but suddenly a group of other people come there with their own values and pervert mindset, they started to kill those couple who make love and punish those women who show skin and started to rape them either literally or by eyes.<br><br>Now local people also get change thei<br><br>Indian Culture: As a foreigner, why can`t I talk to an Indian woman?<br>Either your friends are misinformed or they are playing with you. You can talk to Indian women and find your body intact after that.<br><br>Nothing wrong will happen to you or the women. You can have small talk and even make friends. Indians are very friendly (that at times we can be nosy) especially when it comes to foreigners. It is a problem only when we Indians approach Indian women. Usually small town women are shy and conservative. Unless you are looking for casual sex you will have...<br><br>What are the reasons that majority of Indians are socially awkward?<br>Its coz we have disunited country, so many gods and goddesses. So many languages and dialects. We identify ourselves on basis of regions, castes and subcastes.<br><br>Not on basis of our country. Its apparant that we are bound to feel awkward. We are so judgemental as people. Inferiority complex is deep seated in subconcious minds of majority.<br><br>Only if we cud say we are Indian , proudly , more than half of our problems would be solved.<br><br>In socially advanced countries , there are minimum disorientations. They have same language, same holy book and same religion all over.<br><br>N above all 1 god.<br><br>Are Indians insecure? Or proud? Or nationalistic? Or simply not exposed?<br>Why are Indians serious, insecure, and in a rush to do everything?<br>Are Indians in general more insecure about our culture? Why is something new always trashed as "aping the west"?<br>Why are indians so ashamed of their own culture and mad about anything foreign?<br>What are Indians most insecure about?<br>What is the biggest culture shock you have ever faced?<br>Why are Indians more insecure about their career compared other nationals?<br>What are the most common traits or habits of Indian youth that you find irritating?<br>Why in India majority of people mostly gossip, do small talk or talk about other people while westerners usually talk about facts, ideas, hobbies, interests or other knowledgeable stuff?<br>What is Indian culture?

But she also suggested that the running attacks that her family has endured in the tabloid press have lacked “gentleness, good humor and understanding.”<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br>“There can be no doubt, of course, that criticism is good for people and institutions that are part of public life,” she said in her statement, which was unusual in that it seemed to come from the heart from a family more known for its stiff upper lip.<br><br>But she added, “I dare say that history will take a slightly more moderate view than that of some contemporary commentators.”<br><br>As for the last year, the queen described it by playing off a more commonly known Latin phrase, annus mirabilis , or “wonderful year.” She said that 1992, “in the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents . . . has turned out to be an annus horribilis. I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.”<br><br>“Indeed,” she added, “I suspect that there are very few people or institutions unaffected by these last months of worldwide turmoil and uncertainty.”<br><br>The queen, bedecked in a dark green dress and hat, delivered her personal message toward the end of a year in which:<br><br>* Her daughter, Princess Anne, was divorced.<br><br>* The Duke and Duchess of York, her second son and daughter-in-law, separated.

Government officials decided Monday that taxpayers should cover the multimillion-dollar costs of repairing the fire damage at the queen’s favorite home.<br><br>But many members of Parliament have complained that the queen, 66, who is one of the world’s richest individuals, with an estimated worth ranging from $135 million to $9 billion, should volunteer to pay at least part of the expense, especially given the fact that the Royal Family pays no income tax.<br><br>The queen did not offer Tuesday to defuse the row over who should pay for the castle’s repairs, and while claiming that constructive criticism could and should act as a force for change in any institution, she did not suggest specific reforms in the beleaguered monarchy, which opinion polls show suffers from a growing unpopularity.<br><br>Reaction to the queen’s speech, as to the Royal Family itself of late, was mixed.<br><br>Margaret Holder, editor of Royalty magazine, told the Associated Press that she was surprised by the address, noting, “This is the first time the queen has said that the monarchy is not above criticism.”<br><br>Patrick McNair Wilson, a Conservative lawmaker, praised the queen’s “personal courage” in a difficult year, while Labor Party leader John Smith was quoted by the AP as saying that she had defended herself “rather wittily and rather charmingly.”<br><br>But members of the opposition Labor Party expressed disappointment that the queen had not offered to help pay for Windsor Castle repairs. “The speech indicates that she realizes there are some very strong feelings about the taxpayer footing the bill for the restoration of Windsor Castle when some priceless historical monuments such as schools throughout the country are falling down,” Bob Cryer, a Labor member of Parliament, was quoted as saying by the AP.<br><br>Labor lawmaker Tony Banks said: “There is no such thing as a bad year for the queen, by definition.

I created 25 and it won't let me create more.<br>How many playlists can I create on YouTube?<br>You are limited to 12 playlist sections which are not the same as playlists.

If so, how can we work on changing that?<br>Narcissm , Sociopathy and Macheivalli are the three traits seen in Indian society. Any psychopathy specialist will love to do a case study in India seeing the devil's haven in this country<br><br>I am not wrong, these traits are in each and every Indians because that is how we were. are and will be. The deciet of an Indian man is highly intriguing. Most men are closet narcissists , sociopath who given the chance would rape a woman or even a man and deem her helpless. I have seen many men and trusted men and women in this society. Most men are misogynists in this culture and it would display once you get to know them<br><br>This is not to show Indians in bad light but rather depict who they are. Oh Yes! This trait is not restricted but women also. See, here people abuse the weakest sections of society such as children, women, elders, lower economic sections<br><br>How does Google track me even when I'm not using it?<br>Google can (and does) track your activity across many non-Google websites and apps. That may be surprising, even if you already know that when you use Google products like Google Search, Chrome, and YouTube, they collect a shocking amount of personal information about you.<br><br>Google trackers are lurking behind most websites.<br><br>Google Analytics — a free Google service used by millions of websites and apps — is actually the biggest cross-site tracker on the Internet, lurking creepily behind the scenes on around 72.6% of the top 75k sites. While “analytics” sounds harmless and is in fact something websites need to improve their services, what’s happening underneath the hood with Google Analytics is anything but harmless or necessary.<br><br>Unlike privacy-focused analytics services, Google uses their Google Analytics tracker for more than just providing information about site visitors and app users to the sites and apps themselves. In many cases Google also adds that same information to Google’s own massive profiles about people. Since Google Analytics is embedded in so many sites, this tracker alone allows Google to see most people’s global browsing history, regardless of whether they use any Google products themselves.<br><br>The second biggest cross-site tracker is also Google’s: aptly named “Global Site Tag” and on around 60% of the top 10K websites. Most of the ads you see online on non-Google websites are actually still coming from Google, and this tracker helps track them. Google uses personal data from Google Analytics, Global Site Tag, and from their many other trackers and products, so they can target you with advertising and content they think you’ll want to see. While 72.6% of the top 75k sites contain Google Analytics, if you look at the full portfolio of Google trackers across those sites, 86.5% contain one or more of them.<br><br><br>Why should you care?<br><br>Most people want to avoid those creepy Google ads that follow you around everywhere online. Google lets advertisers target people based on their Google search history, browsing history, location history, and other personal information collected through Google’s many trackers.<br><br>In addition, all of this data also enables industries like airlines to charge users different prices based upon their personal information (through yet another Google product). Yes, you could be charged more for your next vacation as a result of the data collected about you!<br><br>This data also can be used beyond just ads. It has led to innocent bystanders being suspected of crimes they didn’t commit and can even influence your ability to apply for jobs, get a loan, or rent a home. It also is used to fuel filter bubbles online by using your data in algorithms to suggest content (e.g., links, videos, articles, etc.) Google *thinks* you’ll want to engage with.<br><br>An example is YouTube’s recommended videos where many, including kids, have been recommended unsafe content based on filter bubble algorithms. This happens on Google Search too, where people are served different results based on Google’s profile of them. This type of filter bubble is especially pernicious when searching for political topics because you are not getting unbiased results or seeing what everyone else is seeing (e.g., when researching potential candidates).<br><br>The implications of all this tracking are even more disturbing in aggregate, where this invasive targeting and manipulation can breed extremism and polarization on a societal level as well as influence voting patterns.<br><br>All this Google tracking is hiding in plain sight.<br><br>In public Google tells people a very different story. They try to convince you that they care about privacy and are protecting your data, even as they continue to invade your privacy behind the scenes.<br><br>You’ve probably heard of Google Chrome’s “Incognito Mode”? By using “incognito” in the name, Google has led users to believe that this setting makes you anonymous online, but in reality, it only helps you offline. It just deletes the local copy of your search and browsing history (just the stuff stored on your computer), while doing nothing to curb websites, search engines (including Google), Internet service providers and others, from easily tracking you across the web.<br><br>In Google’s Incognito Mode, none of Google’s trackers are blocked. This is just one example of Google’s false privacy narrative — a narrative that in this case has led to a class-action lawsuit against Google that was recently given the go-ahead in court.<br><br>Google continues to make pledges to protect people’s privacy yet routinely resists disclosing what’s really going on. Every time Google has been forced to pull back the curtain and explain what they’re really doing, the truth about how much data they collect vs. what they actually need to collect is shocking.<br><br>Most recently Google embedded a new tracking method called FLoC in Chrome and started turning it on by default without any explicit opt-in consent from users. Google seems to know that if they were to give people an honest and easy-to-understand explanation of what they are doing with their data followed by a choice of whether to opt-in or not, hardly anyone would opt-in to it.<br><br>In these instances and more, the big G is pushing a false sense of privacy to protect their business model — we call that “privacy washing”. This lack of transparency is an injustice to you, and every consumer. Remember what happened when the big bad wolf dressed in grandma’s clothing? When danger is cloaked in a friendly, familiar disguise, it’s easy to get sucked in (just like poor Little Red).<br><br><br>Take back your privacy!<br><br>The good news is that you can take back your privacy with DuckDuckGo. If you’re unfamiliar with DuckDuckGo, we're the Internet privacy company for everyone who's had enough of hidden online tracking and wants to take back their privacy now.<br><br>Every day millions of people rely on our free all-in-one solution (private search engine, tracker blocker, mobile browser) to stay private online.

I couldn't find a single person in India who really loves their wife with respect.<br>Indian Narcissist Red Flags⚠<br><br>Yes Narcissism is very common in India among Indian men and women but more commonly found in men than women, it is mainly caused by harsh or over controlling childhood upbringing. Indian culture promotes narcissism, there are the 10 symptoms for narcissism.<br><br>⚠1)Easily Critical and over exaggerating you're fault's, can't forgive because deep down they can't forgive themselves<br><br>⚠2)Don't care much about your emotions/feelings(Except to manipulate)<br><br>⚠3)They hijack Conversation<br><br>⚠4)Lack true reflective thinking<br><br>⚠5)They Blame Shift on to you(They don't take responsibility, hides vulnerability)<br><br>⚠6)They insists things go their way follow their plan or agenda.

Plain/Authenticity not appealing<br><br>⚠10)Close minded and impatient, don't want to listen. Secretive, not revealing topical only, shallow. Immature<br><br>Why do they do it?<br><br>These people were brought up in families with over controlling parents, most of their childhood was about their parents critizing them and controlling them and they were never allowed to think independently.<br><br>All these people lack self compassion, they may have a high self esteem(High self worth:Ego) but they lack self compassion, they think their superior to other people but they hate themselves. So narcissists feel superior to others but don’t necessarily like themselves. In fact, narcissists’ feelings about themselves are entirely based on others’ opinions of them.<br><br>People with high self-compassion, on the other hand, are satisfied with themselves and do not feel a sense of superiority over others. Instead, they perceive themselves as valuable individuals, but not more valuable than others. They desire close, intimate relationships with other people and do not need to be excessively admired. Those with high self-compassion rarely become aggressive or angry towards others.<br><br>Treatment:<br><br>DSM-5 Criteria for the Personality Disorders trauma). Narcissistic Personality Disorder. No one can help them only they can, the treatment is self compassion.<br><br>How to deal with a narcissist?<br><br>☑1)Avoid them completely if possible.<br><br>☑2)Have very firm boundaries. Protect your interests with great care. Never ever confide in them.<br><br>☑3)Avoid becoming their enemy or a threat by challenging their grandiose self image.<br><br>☑4)Avoid involvement in their plans if possible.<br><br>☑5)They are horrible planners because they are delusional.<br><br>☑6)Realize that in some way, everything they say is a lie to manipulate you in their sick world. Their grand stories may impress you, charm you, and make you feel good, but its all designed to manipulate you into their web of lies.<br><br>☑7)Don't let them gaslight or bully you. They will always try to convince you that you are somehow mistaken, not clear, illogical, deluded, ignorant or dumb. You just aren't making any sense!Don't trust them ever or rely on them for anything.<br><br>☑8)Don't make vague promises to them like - I will help you. If you have to do something for them, make it simple and clear.<br><br>☑9)Don't kid yourself that you have the problem or that you are to blame.<br><br>☑10)Resist the urge to hate them and get back at them. In time, things never end well for them.<br><br>☑11)Realize that for them, protecting their self image is like survival. It may not be important to you, but to them the worst thing in the world is to be seen as just average. They will go to great lengths and expend great energy just to feel as though they are great.<br><br>☑12)Don't try to fix/change them, they won't change in 98% of the cases and they'll manipulate your mind to make you think that you're the problem. They will make you feel as though there is something really wrong with you and that they are without fault.<br><br>What are some ways I can upgrade office operations?<br>With ways of working rapidly changing, you'll need to adapt new solutions to overcome today's logistical challenges. Being an office manager gives you the responsibility to keep your business operations efficient and streamlined.​<br><br>Consider a cloud-based shipping tool that has analytics to identify areas of improvement in carrier performance and savings. Or tracking software to ensure remote workers can send back equipment without issue. You can also implement smart lockers to make sure items aren't misplaced or stolen. And as your business scales, consider choosing a trusted partner to take on functions like mail operations, project management, or call center assistance. See how Pitney Bowes can help you with each of these solutions.​<br><br><br>Why do Indian parents choose to become authoritative and narcissists like their parents?<br>Indian society doesn't teach to take risk whether it's relationship or investment people avoid risk taking.<br><br>How would you let your child fall for boyfriend or girlfriend if they themselves (if we're single) wouldn't have guts to take risk to ask for date, or risk of toxic relationship, or simply study/work and love life miss balance.<br><br>How would they let their kids invest in shares if they have not investmed any of their money other than fixed deposits forget about mutual funds?<br><br>Now as their fixed deposits are not really paying much due to inflation and having no other passive income or assets they see their kids as financial security in old age how would they ever allow them to be independent and move out and leave them on their on?<br><br>So to summarize because their parents did not let them grow and face loses and allowed them to learn to overcome it they have grown up like a looser.
