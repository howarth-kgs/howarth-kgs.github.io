Thank you, sir.<br><br>11K<br>468<br><br><br><br>AuAg Finder<br>8 months ago<br>I still like Patton’s speech:  “Your job isn’t to die for your country. Your job is to make the other poor bastard die for his country”<br><br>1.9K<br>60<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>Well one of his first in Italy included also something like don´t take prisoners which acutely caused some war crimes and you would hang our officers which gave such orders. What´s then extra bad is how just the lower ranks which acted on the speech got punished and he is still a war hero.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  how much research have you actually done on this subject? Sounds like you just watched a video and went with it<br><br>13<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  Comes from a actual historian, here are a lot on Youtube. "General George S. Patton, The Biscari Massacre and The Slapping Incidents" <br><br>Kinda almost a funny story how he rather got in trouble later for slapping someone and not just making a speech where he calls for no prisoners and then later wants to cover it up when unarmed prisoner get shoot. <br><br>Like allied war crimes are not really something so rare, my village is even famous for being completely burned down by Canadians as retaliation for a SS crime. Not really something common like on both east fronts where they happen probably each day dozen of times but still there where also some in the west. <br><br>While basically all sides terror bombed civilians to break there moral and well this even seemed to backfire and strengthen moral until the US started to drop nukes. To be fair they also bombed the Chinese whit the pest and probably would have caused such a blood bath if invaded this was probably the way to get the least amount of people killed but i am pretty sure nuking civilians is not legal by international law as well as to fire bomb them to death in the 100.´s of thousands. <br><br>I mean are you Americans kinda unaware you also did commit some war crimes? For example what you called moral bombing is basically the same as our idea to terror bomb civilians which is just by any definition a war crime. Also just because the other side starts ignoring international law mean not your also free to ignore it, the Soviet Union had just left all international agreements but that makes the dozens of millions dead POW´s and civilians not better. <br><br>When you really look into this there seems to be quite a doable standard where US war crimes are somewhere between ignored and justified.<br><br>4<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  George Patton said “dont take prisoners” her didnt say “shoot prisoners”. Their is a difference and that is why Patton didn’t get into trouble for the massacre.<br><br>16<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  Kinda makes it not much better when he told his soldiers to shoot people which lay down there arms which no prisoners means. So they basically got in trouble for doing it not soon enough and accepting surrender. <br><br>While he still tried to cover it up and someone else pushed for an investigation, a German would been executed by the allies for this for sure. <br><br>Also just one of the two guy´s killing prisoners got even convicted, not quite sure what this legal principle is exactly  you call Respondeat superior but sounds kinda like for your soldiers they got to make the defense of just following orders when they did not commit any war crimes on there own but where ordered. Which was just not done for Germans where they are responsible for any criminal act if ordered or not.<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  It war and people die in war. You want to argue semantics then ok. A prisoner is defined as “a person captured and kept in by an enemy, opponent or criminal.” Therefore, if they shot the Germans without capturing them, they don’t fit the legal definition if “prisoner”. Therefore General Patton wasn’t ordering his men to commit war crimes because it wouldn’t have been a war crime.<br><br>11<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  No that´s really not semantics oi argue about, more legal and moral responsibility, you are making it about this. It´s really not a huge difference what he ordered was to not take anybody prisoner which still keep fighting when they got at 200 yards which sounds like the idea was to demoralize the enemy. Meaning when they lay down there arms to late his soldiers where suppose to make an example out of them, pretty clear what he was doing there and i bet you Germans giving similar orders would be charged and pretty likely be justified executed. That´s just an clear war crime, look at this, it´s even worse then i had remembered it. 100% any German you captured and you know about giving such orders would be killed for it. <br><br>"When we land against the enemy, don’t forget to hit him and hit him hard. We will bring the fight home to him. We will show him no mercy. He has killed thousands of your comrades, and he must die. If you company officers in leading your men against the enemy find him shooting at you and, when you get within two hundred yards of him and he wishes to surrender, oh no! That bastard will die! You will kill him. Stick him between the third and fourth ribs. You will tell your men that. They must have the killer instinct. Tell them to stick him. He can do no good then. Stick them in the liver. We will get the name of killers and killers are immortal. When word reaches him that he is being faced by a killer battalion, a killer outfit, he will fight less. Particularly, we must build up that name as killers and you will get that down to your troops in time for the invasion"<br><br>5<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  you are claiming that he told his troops to commit a war crime. You made it about legality, I’m arguing that what he ordered his men to do wasn’t illegal and therefore not a war crime. Now what his men did do was a war crime because they accepted the enemy surrender and killed them afterwards when they were actually prisoners. You can surrender all day long but you aren’t legally a prisoner until you are captured. You aren’t considered captured until the enemy accepts your surrender.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>Missy Victoria<br>8 months ago<br>I like when Gen Geo S Patton said "we have beaten the wrong enemy".. referring to Hitler. Patton was going to come out with the truth about Allies and Communist collaboration to beat Hitler... and he was in a seriously life-threatening automobile "accident." 12 days into his recovery while in the hospital... he was poisoned to death. No doubt, by his own country. "Merica!<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Kyle Rittenhouse's AR-15<br>7 months ago<br> @king oli  <br><br>That's not what happened. Patton ordered that any enemy units that hadn't surrendered by the time American forces got within 200 yards, then any attempted surrender should not be accepted. In those massacres however, the surrender had been accepted and then the prisoners were summarily executed.<br><br>So no, they weren't following Patton's orders. Which is exactly why he was not implicated in those proceedings.

At the time, he was only 11 years old. Throughout the years of Japan’s occupation of Malaya, my grandpa had shared stories of their cruelty, he and my great grandmother had been beaten ruthlessly by Japanese troops for reasons such as not bowing to an officer or sometimes seemingly for no reason at all. Fearing that my great grandmother would’ve been raped eventually, this had led to him urging my great grandmother into running away and hiding in the jungles. From what he told me, they essentially lived through hell. For 4 years, they were starving and were in constant fear of the Japanese patrols finding them. My great grandmother fell ill from diseases caused by mosquitoes and without medical supplies, she passed away. With her gone, my grandfather was on his own  for another year until news broke out that the Japanese had surrendered due to the atom bombings. It was one of the happiest moments of his life. Furthermore, with years of jungle experience, my grandfather grew up to be a police captain fighting against the communist forces in the jungle during what is now known as the Malayan Communist Insurgency.<br><br>659<br>41<br><br><br><br>Cipher Code<br>7 months ago<br>fishing.

My dad was a little boy in Burma, when the Japanese invaded. He would never share the full story but bits and pieces. I wish he would have told us more before he passed away. He was always very secretive about his childhood.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>Darkgreen Marine<br>1 year ago<br>I do!!<br><br><br><br><br>You cant beat K<br>1 year ago<br>Maybe they're not amazing then.<br><br><br><br><br>Tim Monbrod<br>1 year ago<br>Wise people will always listen...<br><br><br><br><br>Tim Monbrod<br>1 year ago<br>Everyone has stories.<br>Some people just want to forget what they went through...<br>I respect those that can talk about war and those that never talk about it.

I had the pleasure as a boy to hear about both wars. My grandfather passed away in 1980 when I was 10. I remember sitting with him and thinking how cool it was that he was alive during the 1800s. That was a different generation. Even my dad would roll over in his grave to see his country the way it is now.<br><br>92<br>10<br><br><br>Teddy Jones<br>1 month ago<br>This guy's one hell of an American wish we had more like him<br><br>63<br>3<br><br><br>Histalian<br>7 months ago<br>Love this guy.

Different forms of torture, he had a drink his own piss a lot. He ate bugs and rats you name it. He also survived the Bataan death March. Read about it. Thank god he was 10 times tougher than me and you as he lived and made it home. Then went on to be very successful in life once home. Wife kids.

Marine first and foremost. That speaks volumes. My uncle was a U.S. Marine in the Pacific, island hopping and fighting as this Marine describes, hand to hand. He came home with a heaping helping of the then undiagnosed PTSD. Once home, he had to go off and be alone for over a year to get straight but you could tell, it was a burden which he carried with himself the rest of his life.<br><br>135<br>17<br><br><br>Incog Neato<br>4 months ago<br>This man is a legend.
