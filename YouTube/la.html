As Europe faces its worst energy crunch in decades amid the war in Ukraine, national capitals have been scrambling to shore up their gas reserves ahead of the winter. But another fuel could also soon be in short supply: coal. Although the highly polluting fuel has earned pariah status as the EU looks to slash emissions, consumption is on the rise as a number of countries, including Austria and the Netherlands, either switch old coal-fired plants back on or boost existing capacity to save on gas.

The Senate report revealed that "most of the videos" put out by the Russian IRA troll factory on YouTube "pertained to police brutality and the activist efforts of the Black Lives Matter organization" and found that "no single group of Americans was targeted... more than African-Americans" around "race and related issues".

In speaking about current conflicts, we focus on the surface “issues” that divide us – a record inflation, off-the-charts crime waves in our urban centers, a humanitarian crisis at our southern border. Sometimes we sum it up as a double standard in the justice system that treats violent leftists as “peaceful protesters” and public school parents concerned...<br>The Bible In Paintings: ISAIAH – "HERE AM I, SEND ME!"<br>8/5/2022, 6:49:38 PM · by Hebrews 11:6 · 5 replies<br>The Bible In Paintings 2 ENCOURAGEMENT FOR APPRECIATING AND APPLYING GOD'S MESSAGE "HERE AM I, SEND ME!"

According to people on Twitter, at least sixty-two 3D-printed pistols were turned in at $150 each. That would be a total of $9,300 for the box of mostly plastic pistols.

Their language, also called Kusunda, is unique: it is believed by linguists to be unrelated to any other language in the world. Scholars still aren't sure how it originated. And it has a variety of unusual elements, including lacking any standard way of negating a sentence, words for "yes" or "no", any words for direction, or even a set grammatical structure.<br><br>According to the latest Nepali census data from 2011, there are 273 Kusunda remaining. But only one woman, 48-year-old Kamala Khatri, is known to be fluent.<br><br>Hima Kusunda attends a boarding school where she is also learning her native language (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br>Hima Kusunda attends a boarding school where she is also learning her native language (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br><br>The Kusunda are highly marginalised and impoverished within Nepali society. Today, most live in west Nepal's Dang district, a sleepy region of yellow mustard fields and misty, wooded hills. It is here the Language Commission of Nepal has been running Kusunda classes since 2019 in an effort to preserve the language. In the last decade, as the government of Nepal has launched schemes to help Nepal's indigenous groups, it has also begun paying for Hima and other Kusunda children from remote areas to board at Mahindra High School in Dang – sometimes as much as a 10-hour drive away – where they are also being taught their native language.<br><br>Hima, originally from the rural Pyuthan district bordering Dang, has been learning Kusunda for two years. She now is able to speak it at a basic level. "Before coming to school in Dang, I didn't know any Kusunda language," she says. "But I am proud to know Kusunda now, even though I didn't learn it from birth.<br><br>"I used to listen to other [ethnic groups], like Tharus and Magars, speaking their language, and wonder what it would be like to converse in my mother tongue. I think it is very important for me, and others, to protect this language."<br><br>A language on the brink<br><br>Originally semi-nomadic, the Kusunda lived in the jungles of west Nepal until the middle of the 20th Century, hunting birds and monitor lizards, and trading yams and meat for rice and flour in nearby towns. While they are now settled in villages, they still call themselves the Ban Rajas, or kings of the forest.<br><br>But as Nepal's population grew and farming increasingly fragmented the jungles, pressure on the Kusundas' homeland increased. Then, in the 1950s, the government nationalised great swathes of forests, presenting further obstacles to their nomadic life.<br><br>The Kusunda were forced to settle, turning to jobs in labouring and agriculture. Low numbers in the group and the disparate nature of their population meant they mostly married neighbouring ethnic groups. Almost all stopped speaking their language.<br><br>For the Kusunda people, losing their language means losing a link to their past, and to their identity.<br><br>From a linguistic point of view, it is a loss in other ways, too.<br><br>Madhav Pokharel, emeritus professor of linguistics at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, has been overseeing the documentation of the Kusunda language over the last 15 years. He explains that several studies have attempted to link it with other language isolates, such as Burushaski from north Pakistan and Nihali from India. But all have failed to find any robust conclusions.<br><br>Once nomadic, most Kusunda today live in the Dang district of west Nepal (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br>Once nomadic, most Kusunda today live in the Dang district of west Nepal (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br><br>Currently, linguistic researchers believe Kusunda is a survivor of an ancient aboriginal language spoken across the sub-Himalayan regions before the arrival of the Tibetan-Burman and Indo-Aryan tribes.<br><br>"We can trace all other language groups in Nepal to people coming from outside Nepal," says Pokharel. "It is only Kusunda whose origins we don't know."<br><br>There is no standard way of negating a sentence. Indeed, the language has few words implying anything negative<br>Alongside its mysterious beginnings, linguists have noted Kusunda's many rare elements. Bhojraj Gautam, a linguist with in-depth knowledge of Kusunda, describes one of the most peculiar: there is no standard way of negating a sentence. Indeed, the language has few words implying anything negative. Instead, context is used to convey the exact meaning. If you want to say "I don't want tea", for example, you might use the verb to drink, but in an adjusted form which indicates a very low probability – synonymous with the speaker's desire – of the drinking of tea.<br><br>Kusunda also has no words for absolute directions, such as left or right, with the speaker using relative phrases such as "to this side" and "to that side" instead.<br><br>Meanwhile, linguists say Kusunda does not have the set grammatical rules or structures found in most languages. Instead, phrases must be interpreted relative to the speaker. For example, actions are not divided into past and present. When saying "I saw a bird" compared to "I will see a bird", a Kusunda speaker might indicate the past action not by tense, but by describing it as an experience directly related to the speaker. Meanwhile, the future action would remain general and not associated to any subject.<br><br>Ironically, these rare qualities – a large part of what makes Kusunda so fascinating to linguists – are partly why it has struggled to continue.<br><br>Kamala Khatri, Kusunda's last fluent speaker, clasps a glass of hot water in Ghorahi's only coffee shop. She did not teach the Kusunda language to her own children, she says. "I thought they should learn Nepali because it is useful," she explains. "People would make fun of our language, and say it wasn't normal. Kusunda speakers faced a lot of stigma. But now I feel regretful that I can't converse with my own children in our own language."<br><br>Kamala Khatri is the last fluent speaker of Kusunda (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br>Kamala Khatri is the last fluent speaker of Kusunda (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br><br>Khatri is now working with the Language Commission, teaching Kusunda in Ghorahi to 10 community members. "If we can regularly practise, speak, sing our songs, then we might be able to keep our language alive," she says.<br><br>In Pokharel's view, collaborative learning among the remaining Kusunda is the key to the preservation of the language. He also emphasises the importance of the Kusunda speakers being in the environments in which they grew up to help stimulate their memories. "If we can bring all the Kusunda to the same place, in the habitat which they claim, then one Kusunda would tell his stories to another Kusunda, and this would revive their memories," Pokharel says.<br><br>Modern technology is also being employed in the current revitalisation efforts. NowHere Media, a Berlin-based media studio, has been working with the Kusunda to assist them in documenting their language, culture and traditions. Most notably, NowHere has produced  a virtual reality documentary which uses 3D animation to depict the Kusundas' nomadic life as hunter-gatherers. NowHere co-founder Gayatri Parameswaran explains that the viewers, wearing headsets, are absorbed into this environment, and must learn and speak words in Kusunda to interact with the story and continue with the narrative. The overall aim, Parameswaran explains, is to create a digital archive that would be available to future generations.<br><br>Preservation of the Kusunda language, however, is only part of the story. According to Dhan Bahadur Kusunda, the chairman of the Nepal Kusunda Development Society, most Kusunda live below the poverty line, with no land rights, and work as labourers or porters. "Economically, socially, and in terms of health and education, the Kusunda are very disadvantaged," Kusunda says.<br><br>This is where raising awareness of the Kusunda language itself could help: it is an effective way of drawing attention to the Kusunda's marginalisation, says Lok Bahadur Lopchan, the secretary of the Language Commission. "Other language revitalisation projects in Nepal have been with communities that are much better off than the Kusunda," Lopchan says. "For these groups, language preservation it is just a sentimental idea. It doesn't bring them any other tangible benefits."<br><br>"The Kusunda however, are very marginalised and therefore it is more important to build a profile as a language speaking community."<br><br>Others agree. "If the Kusunda don't have their language, there is nothing to distinguish them from all the other marginalised groups in Nepal. The language is giving them an identity, and drawing the attention of the government," says Lopchan.<br><br>A student practises Kusunda at Mahindra High School (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br>A student practises Kusunda at Mahindra High School (Credit: Eileen McDougall)<br><br>With the help of researchers including post-doctoral fellow at University of London Tim Bodt, the Kusunda are now asking for a piece of land for an "ekikrit basti", or unified settlement, where all the Kusunda would live. Bodt and his Nepali research partner, Uday Raj Aaley, are currently looking for funding for a feasibility study for this new settlement.<br><br>According to Bodt, this settlement would not only secure the community's land rights and provide a health centre and school – it would also bring the group together, giving them the opportunity to learn and converse in their language.<br><br>Revitalised language, revitalised wellbeing<br><br>There are other potential benefits of revitalising the Kusunda language, too. <br><br>There is a growing body of research that has found indigenous language revitalisation associated with higher indicators of physical and mental wellbeing. Studies have found indigenous language use in North America to correlate with lower rates of cigarette use in the population, higher levels of physical and mental wellness indicators and lower levels of diabetes, for example.<br><br>Language shift is often associated with historical trauma from colonisation or oppression, and with loss of self-worth – Julia Sallabank<br>Meanwhile, a study in British Columbia, Canada found that youth suicide was six times higher in indigenous communities where less than 50% of the members were conversationally fluent in their native language. In aboriginal and Torres Strait communities of Australia, indigenous language speakers exhibit lower rates of binge drinking and illegal drug use.<br><br>"Language shift is often associated with historical trauma from colonisation or oppression, and with loss of self-worth," says Julia Sallabank, professor of language policy and revitalisation at University of London. "So we can try to turn this round: reclaiming one's language and cultural identity can be empowering, at both personal and community level."<br><br>Back in Dang, one Kusunda member feels that way is 18-year-old Hima.<br><br>"I think I can take this language forward," she says. "If we can regularly speak and practice Kusunda, then we can keep the language alive. It's about having interest in our language and pride in our identity."<br><br>In the future, she says, she knows what she wants to do as a career: become a language teacher and teach Kusunda.<br><br>--<br><br>Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.<br><br>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called "The Essential List" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.<br><br>Share using Email<br>Share on Twitter<br>Share on Facebook<br>Share on Linkedin<br><br>SHARE<br>NEUROSCIENCE<br>How our brains cope with speaking more than one language<br>Share using Email<br>Share on Twitter<br>Share on Facebook<br>Share on Linkedin<br>(Image credit: Alamy)<br>Speaking multiple languages can have some surprising effects on the brain<br>By Nicole Chang<br>20th July 2022<br>Speaking a second or even a third language can bring obvious advantages, but occasionally the words, grammar and even accents can get mixed up. This can reveal surprising things about how our brains work.<br>Article continues below<br><br>I<br>I'm standing in line at my local bakery in Paris, apologising to an incredibly confused shopkeeper. He's just asked how many pastries I would like, and completely inadvertently, I responded in Mandarin instead of French. I'm equally baffled: I'm a dominant English speaker, and haven't used Mandarin properly in years. And yet, here in this most Parisian of settings, it somehow decided to reassert itself.<br><br>Multilinguals commonly juggle the languages they know with ease. But sometimes, accidental slip-ups can occur. And the science behind why this happens is revealing surprising insights into how our brains work.<br><br>Research into how multilingual people juggle more than one language in their minds is complex and sometimes counterintuitive. It turns out that when a multilingual person wants to speak, the languages they know can be active at the same time, even if only one gets used. These languages can interfere with each other, for example intruding into speech just when you don't expect them. And interference can manifest itself not just in vocabulary slip-ups, but even on the level of grammar or accent.<br><br>"From research we know that as a bilingual or multilingual, whenever you're speaking, both languages or all the languages that you know are activated," says Mathieu Declerck, a senior research fellow at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels. "For example, when you want to say 'dog' as a French-English bilingual, not just 'dog' is activated, but also its translation equivalent, so 'chien' is also activated."<br><br>As such, the speaker needs to have some sort of language control process. If you think about it, the ability of bilingual and multilingual speakers to separate the languages they have learned is remarkable. How they do this is commonly explained through the concept of inhibition – a suppression of the non-relevant languages. When a bilingual volunteer is asked to name a colour shown on a screen in one language and then the next colour in their other language, it is possible to measure spikes in electrical activity in parts of the brain that deal with language and attentional awareness.<br><br>When this control system fails, however, intrusions and lapses can occur. For example, insufficient inhibition of a language can cause it to "pop up" and intrude when you're meant to be speaking in a different one.<br><br>Rather than switching different languages on and off, they are always active in our brains and the unwanted language is inhibited (Credit: Jeffrey Greenberg/Getty Images)<br>Rather than switching different languages on and off, they are always active in our brains and the unwanted language is inhibited (Credit: Jeffrey Greenberg/Getty Images)<br><br>Declerck himself is no stranger to accidentally mixing up languages. The Belgian native's impressive language repertoire includes Dutch, English, German and French. When he used to work in Germany, a regular train journey home to Belgium could encompass multiple different language zones – and a substantial workout for his language-switching skills.<br><br>"The first part was in German and I'd step on a Belgian train where the second part was in French," he says. "And then when you pass Brussels, they change the language to Dutch, which is my native language. So in that span of like three hours, every time the conductor came over, I had to switch languages.<br><br>"I always responded in the wrong language, somehow. It was just impossible to keep up with it."<br><br>In fact, language-switching scenarios – albeit in a laboratory rather than on a train – are often used by researchers to learn more about how multilingual people control their languages. And errors can be a great way to gain insight into how we use and control the languages we know.<br><br>Tamar Gollan, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California San Diego, has been studying language control in bilinguals for years. Her research has often led to counterintuitive findings.<br><br>"I think maybe one of the most unique things that we've seen in bilinguals when they're mixing languages is that sometimes, it seems like they inhibit the dominant language so much that they actually are slower to speak in certain contexts," she says.<br><br>In other words, a multilingual person’s dominant language can sometimes take a bigger hit in certain scenarios. For example, in that colour naming task described earlier, it can take longer for a participant to recall a word in their first language when switching from their second, compared to the other way around.<br><br>Participants sometimes read out a word in the right language, but with the wrong accent<br>In one of her experiments, Gollan analysed the language-switching abilities of Spanish-English bilinguals by having them read aloud paragraphs that were just in English, just in Spanish, and paragraphs that haphazardly mixed both English and Spanish.<br><br>The findings were startling. Even though they had the texts right there in front of them, participants would still make "intrusion errors" when reading aloud, for example, accidentally saying the Spanish word "pero" instead of the English word "but". These types of errors almost exclusively happened when they were reading aloud the mixed-language paragraphs, which necessitated switching between languages.<br><br>Even more surprising was that a large proportion of these intrusion errors weren't words that participants had "skipped over" at all. Through the use of eye-tracking technology, Gollan and her team found that these mistakes were made even when participants were looking directly at the target word.<br><br>And even though the majority of participants were dominant English speakers, they made more of these intrusion errors for words in English rather than their weaker Spanish – something that Gollan explains is almost like a reversal of language dominance.<br><br>You might also like:<br><br>The people with no word for dinosaur<br>What does being fluent really mean?<br>The surprising power of reading aloud<br>"I think the best analogy is, imagine that there's some condition in which you suddenly become better at writing in your non-dominant hand," she says. "We've been calling this reversed dominance, we've been making a really big deal out of it because the more I think about it, the more I realise how unique this is, and how crazy it is."<br><br>This can even happen when we are learning a second language – when adults are immersed in the new language, they can find it harder to access the words from their native language.<br><br>Reversed dominance effects can be particularly evident when bilinguals switch between languages in a single conversation, says Gollan. She explains that when mixing languages, multilinguals are navigating a sort of balancing act, inhibiting the stronger language to even things out ​​– and sometimes, they go too far in the wrong direction.<br><br>"Bilinguals try to make both languages about equally accessible, by inhibiting the dominant language to make mixing back and forth easier," she says. "But they sometimes 'overshoot' that inhibition, and it ends up coming out slower than the non-dominant language."<br><br>Switching rapidly between languages is when most "language interference" can occur, affecting not just words but pronunciation and grammar (Credit: Getty Images)<br>Switching rapidly between languages is when most "language interference" can occur, affecting not just words but pronunciation and grammar (Credit: Getty Images)<br><br>Gollan's experiments also found reversed dominance in another surprising area – pronunciation. Participants sometimes read out a word in the right language, but with the wrong accent. And again, this happened more for English words than Spanish ones.<br><br>"Sometimes bilinguals will produce the right word, but with the wrong accent, which is a really interesting dissociation that tells you language control is being applied at different levels of processing," says Gollan. "And there's a separation between specification of accent, and specification of which lexicon you're going to be drawing the words from."<br><br>And even our use of grammar in our native language can also be affected in some surprising ways, especially if you've been highly immersed in a different language environment.<br><br>"The brain is malleable and adaptable," says Kristina Kasparian, a writer, translator and consultant who studied neurolinguistics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. "When you're immersed in a second language, it does impact the way you perceive and process your native language. <br><br>As part of a wider project done for her PhD research, Kasparian and her colleagues tested Italian natives who had emigrated to Canada and learned English as adults. All of them had anecdotally reported that their Italian was getting rusty, and that they didn't use it much in day-to-day life.<br><br>Participants were shown a series of sentences in Italian, and asked to rate how acceptable they were. At the same time, their brain activity was also measured through an electroencephalography (EEG) method. Their responses were compared to those of a group of monolingual Italians living in Italy.<br><br>Italian migrants were more likely to reject correct Italian sentences as ungrammatical if these did not match correct English grammar<br>"There were four different types of sentences, and two of them were acceptable both in Italian and in English, and two of them were acceptable only in Italian," says Kasparian.<br><br>An example of the latter type would be the sentence: "I ladri che arresta il poliziotto attendono in macchina." (In English: "The thieves that arrests the policeman wait in the car.")<br><br>As it turns out, the Italian migrants were more likely to reject correct Italian sentences as ungrammatical if these did not match correct English grammar. And the higher their English proficiency, the longer they had lived in Canada, and the less they used their Italian, the more likely they were to have found the correct Italian sentences ungrammatical.<br><br>They also showed different patterns of brain activity as compared to the Italians living in Italy. Using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to record of brain activity, Kasparian and her colleagues aimed to capture a "millisecond-by-millisecond snapshot" of the electrical activity in participants' brains as language processing unfolded. <br><br>They found that, when presented with the sentences that were grammatically acceptable only in Italian (but not in English), the Italians living in Canada showed different brain activity patterns compared to those back in Italy.<br><br>In fact, their brain activity was more consistent with what would be expected from English speakers, says Kasparian, suggesting that their brains were processing the sentences differently to their monolingual counterparts back home.<br><br>English relies more on word order than Italian, explains Kasparian. And the migrants were relying more on the English grammar cues, she says, even though they were reading in Italian. "Even a first language can change, even if it's a language that you've used every day for most of your life," she says.<br><br>Immersing yourself in a foreign language is often the best way to learn it, but it can come at the temporary cost of your native tongue (Credit: Getty Images)<br>Immersing yourself in a foreign language is often the best way to learn it, but it can come at the temporary cost of your native tongue (Credit: Getty Images)<br><br>Of course, most multilingual people are quite capable of keeping their native language’s grammar straight. But Kasparian's study, as well as others done as part of her wider research project, show that our languages aren't just static throughout our lives but shifting, actively competing and interfering with each other.<br><br>Navigating such interference could perhaps be part of what makes it hard for an adult to learn a new language, especially if they've grown up monolingual.<br><br>"Every time you go to speak this new language, the other language is like, ‘hey, I'm here, ready to go’,” says Matt Goldrick, aprofessor of linguistics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. "So, the challenge is, you have to suppress this thing that is so automatic, and so easy to do, in favour of this thing that's incredibly hard to do as you're first learning it.<br><br>"You're having to learn how to pull back on the reins something that you normally never have to inhibit, it just comes out naturally, right? There's no reason to pull it back. And so that's I think a very hard skill that one has to develop, and that's part of why it's so hard."<br><br>One thing that might help? Immersing yourself in the environment of the foreign language.<br><br>"You're creating a context in which you're strongly holding back this other language and you're getting a lot of practice holding back that other thing, so that gives room for the other (new) language to become stronger," says Goldrick.<br><br>Being multilingual can have advantages too when it comes, and some research suggests it can improve multitasking (Credit: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images)<br>Being multilingual can have advantages too when it comes, and some research suggests it can improve multitasking (Credit: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images)<br><br>"And then when you return from that immersion experience, you're hopefully in a spot where you can better manage that competition," he adds. "It's never going to go away, that competition will never go away, you just get better at managing it."<br><br>Managing competition is certainly something that multilinguals do tend to have a lot of practice in. Many researchers argue that this brings them certain cognitive advantages – although it’s worth noting that the jury's still out on this, with others saying their own research does not show reliable evidence for a bilingual cognitive advantage.<br><br>In any case, using languages is arguably one of the most complex activities humans learn how to do. And having to manage multiple languages has been linked to cognitive benefits in many studies, depending on task and age.<br><br>Some studies have shown bilinguals perform better on executive control tasks, for example in activities when participants have to focus on counterintuitive information. Speaking multiple languages has also been linked to delayed onset of dementia symptoms. And of course, multilingualism brings many obvious benefits beyond the brain, not least the social benefit of being able to speak to many people.<br><br>But although my multilingualism may have brought me some advantages, it hasn't spared my blushes. Somewhat shamefully, I haven't been backto that particular bakery since my accidental language slip-up. So, maybe more pastry trips are in order – all in the name of practising language control, of course.<br><br>--<br><br>Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.<br><br>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called "The Essential List" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.<br><br><br>Continue reading<br>WISE WORDS | SOCIAL MEDIA<br>Facebook and the true meaning of 'meta'<br>Share using Email<br>Share on Twitter<br>Share on Facebook<br>Share on Linkedin<br>(Image credit: Getty Images)<br>Facebook recently rebranded as Meta (Credit: Getty Images)<br>By Nathan Dufour Oglesby<br>15th November 2021<br>Prefixes rarely make headlines, but with Facebook's rebrand, "meta" became a word for 2021. Nathan Dufour explores its ancient origins to find out what it says about our present.<br>Article continues below<br><br>I<br>In the wake of Facebook's recent rebranding, we've been hearing a lot about the word meta.<br><br>Freed from its usual role in English as a prefix in words like "metaphor", "metastasise" and "metamorphosis", it now stands alone as a proper noun, the new name of a social media monolith with the self-declared purpose of ushering its users into the "metaverse".  <br><br>Meta’s metaverse will apparently entail augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies, to effectuate an immersive online experience – an "embodied internet", where users are not just scrolling, posting and commenting, but interacting in a fully-realised computer-generated world.<br><br>Worlds such as this already exist, with games like Minecraft, Roblox and Second Life, which to varying degrees merit the name of "metaverse", depending on whom you ask and how it’s being defined. Indeed, much ink (or rather, many a pixel) has recently been spilled over precisely this question – what is a metaverse? And is it a good thing?<br><br>But let's explore these questions by asking a more fundamental, and lexical one (a meta-question, if you will): what does the expression meta mean, and what does it symbolise? And what does that have to do with Facebook's new name and vision?<br><br>More from the Wise Words series:<br><br>Generational amnesia: The memory loss that harms the planet<br>Social cryptomnesia: How societies steal ideas<br>The unseen 'slow violence' that affects millions<br>The term metaverse was coined by Neil Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash, a speculative epic whose action takes place in two parallel worlds – primary, physical "Reality", and the online, virtual "Metaverse" existing alongside it. Reality is dominated by malevolent mega-corporations who have privatised every sector of human life, and the Metaverse is fraught with danger, intrigue and corruption.<br><br>The metaverse supposedly spans the physical and digital worlds (Credit: Getty Images)<br>The metaverse supposedly spans the physical and digital worlds (Credit: Getty Images)<br><br>One may wonder whether this consideration factored into Meta’s rebranding process – that the origin of the concept with which they’ve made themselves synonymous is so distinctly tinged with sci-fi ominousness, and the spectre of worldwide corporatocracy.<br><br>But the prefix itself, meta-, was originally an innocent preposition. (Meta is not the first company to appropriate a preposition; I can no longer think of the German über without thinking of taking a ride somewhere.)<br><br>It derives from the Greek μετά, which encompasses a wide array of meanings, such as "with", "after", "alongside", "on top of" and "beyond". A metaphor, for instance, is literally an act of carrying (phora) something beyond (meta). In general, meta- can also denote a change of place or state, as in metamorphosis.<br><br>One can see how these spatially relational meanings pertain to the recently coined "metaverse" – it refers to a reality existing alongside, upon or beyond the confines of the supposedly primary reality that preexists it, a transcendence of what came before.<br><br>But this qualitative aspect of "transcendence" – the connotative aura which makes Meta such a ponderous choice of brand name – did not always attach to the word, and in fact may have glommed onto it only by virtue of an historical accident.<br><br>Aristotle lost in thought with his hand on a bust of Homer – perhaps even contemplating a little metaphysics (Credit: Getty Images)<br>Aristotle lost in thought with his hand on a bust of Homer – perhaps even contemplating a little metaphysics (Credit: Getty Images)<br><br>It’s from the Greek philosopher Aristotle that we get the term "metaphysics", the branch of philosophy devoted to the most ultimate categories of existence – things like "substance", "being" or "actuality" – which he examines systematically in the work of that name.<br><br>Except, that’s not what Aristotle himself named the work (which may not have been a finished work at all, so much as a hodgepodge of notes and smaller treatises). Rather, the title seems to have arisen simply because in the traditional ordering of his collected works, it was placed after (meta) another work called the Physics.<br><br>Hence, the phrase Meta-physica, meant to merely label "the book after the book about nature (the Physica)", came to refer to the whole philosophical department in which one asks the biggest, broadest questions that can possibly be asked.<br><br>It now refers to a conceptual layer of something that is beyond or transcendent of the thing itself<br>Because of the exalted status of metaphysics (both the book and concept) among the concerns of later Western philosophy, the prefix meta- came to be associated with transcending, comprehending and encompassing. And by extension from that, it now refers to a conceptual layer of something that is beyond or transcendent of the thing itself, and is hence denotes self-awareness or self-reflection.<br><br>This shows up in academic discourse, when it gets tacked on to the front of various terms and concepts – metalanguage, metaethics, and so on – when theorists of a given discipline theorise about the parameters of the discipline or concept itself.<br><br>Relatedly, in colloquial English, meta has become an adjective, which essentially means extremely self-aware, self-reflective, or self-referential– as in the phrase, "that’s so meta". Just as every academic takes a secret delight in the arcane jargon of their discipline’s meta-theory, so does each participant in discourse relish the performance of self-awareness that we call meta – everyone wants to be in on the joke.<br><br>Memes, for instance, are especially given to meta-reference – their meaning, and their humour, derive from their creators’ and viewers’ shared awareness of the template’s foregoing iterations. It’s not a funny picture in and of itself, but because of all the uses of that same picture before it, and the self-aware extra layer that the latest caption lays on top ofit. In the age of information, meta-reference is the soul of wit. <br><br>It has been the triumph of entertainment franchises to notice that meta-reference and meta-narrative can be commodified. For Meta is not the only company expanding into the metaverse – the same is true for companies like Disney, which owns universes like Star Wars, Marvel and others, into which, as metaverses, they will undoubtedly be inviting their audiences not just as spectators but as participants. (Incidentally, New York Comic Con now offers virtual attendance billed as "Metaverse Membership".)<br><br>Characters from Ready Player One, at the launch of the movie (Credit: Getty Images)<br>Characters from Ready Player One, at the launch of the movie (Credit: Getty Images)<br><br>This very phenomenon was in fact foretold by another metaverse-themed 2011 novel, Ready Player One, made later into a movie – which returns us to the anxieties implicit there and in Snow Crash. For while the user may participate in the metaverse with apparent freedom, they remain subject to those who control the medium itself – the artists and programmers who create that world, and ultimately the powers behind them. Insofar as the simulators control the simulation, they control those who are simulated.<br><br>In a sense, this is not far from what companies like Meta have been doing all along. For in giving us spaces in which to create and promulgate our handles, our pages, our brands, they have been luring us into a kind of simulation – one that is characterised not by unity of experience across users, but fragmentation into the pigeon-holes of experience, the selective streams of information, the personalised and curated narratives, that characterise social media.<br><br>Our handles, and the whole apparatus by virtue of which we become @ourselves, rather than being ourselves, represent meta-layers of identity, laid on top of us, and reaching out beyond us. We are beside ourselves.<br><br>The opportunity to develop an avatar to represent our (chosen) bodies in virtual space merely makes more literal and vivid a phenomenon that has already been going on – we are already in a metaverse, one in which the storylines run so thick and abundant that unmediated access to the "primary reality" has long since vanished, if indeed it was ever there.<br><br>Is the metaverse something that’s meant to work beneficially with our world, and our nature? Or are you asking us to pass beyond this world?<br>The question for Meta then, and for any other company coaxing us into a manifest metaverse, would be, what sense of the word "meta" do you mean?<br><br>Is the metaverse something that’s meant to work beneficially with our world, and our nature? Or are you asking us to pass beyond this world, as though there’s some need to escape what’s already here? Do you mean "with, alongside", or do you mean "beyond"?<br><br>This connects to a broader technological (and philosophical) question about whether progress consists in "getting beyond" the square one of primary reality – the "beyond" we chase, urged by the illusion of the inadequacy of the here and now. How do our attitudes to that question inform our relationship with the planet, and our use of the internet?<br><br>Viewing meta with an even closer etymological lens, we find that it comes from the Proto-Indo-European root element *me-, the same root that goes into the Old English mið, meaning "with" or "among", which is in turn related to the modern English middle.<br><br>This may bring the phenomenology of our virtual experience into even sharper relief. For it seems to be the nature of human experience to be in the middle of things, constantly at the fulcrum point between our physical selves and the possibilities of transcendence that are suggested by our consciousness.<br><br>We dwell in the middle space between our inherent limitations and the theoretical limitlessness of our technological extensions. And our technologies – like language, writing, telecommunication and virtual reality – have each in turn constituted a metamorphosis in our collective being.<br><br>Poised in this middle space, we must consider what kind of -verse we want the metaverse to be. The word "verse" literally implies a turning (from the Latin vertere, to turn) – and so in a cosmological sense, the Universe is a turning-as-one. It remains to be seen whether our metaverses will be a turning-away from that shared movement, and as such a contortion, or a turning-with, and as such a harmony.<br><br>An escape, or a genuine connection?

Stephen Freeman<br><br><br>The Last Enemy (as named by St. Paul in 1Cor 15:26) was also the first enemy, and has been our enemy throughout human existence: it is death. Death is more than the separation of the soul from the body, it is the threat of non-being. In the writings of the Fathers, particularly those of the East, being is equated with goodness. For it was God who called all things into existence and saw that they were “very good.” As such, being and goodness are deeply and utterly intertwined. We do not say that any created thing is inherently evil. If it has existence, that existence is good. This same fundamental understanding yields its opposite: non-being has the character of evil, or, more accurately, we can say that what we term as “evil” is simply the character and work of non-being. So, Jesus says of Satan that “he was a murderer from the beginning,” and “he is the father of lies.”<br><br>In the work of the fathers, most famously in St. Dionysius, evil is described as a “parasite.” It has no existence of its own but rather works to pervert that which does have existence. So evil is not a “thing” or something “existing.” Rather, it is a will, a perversion, a misdirection and an attempt to direct being towards non-being. This is the ultimate rebellion against the goodness of God who is Being, “Being beyond all being,” the source of all existence and every good thing.<br><br>There are a variety of ways that this movement towards non-being manifests itself in our lives.<br><br>Christ describes two of them. He tells us that if we are angry with our brother, we have committed murder. He also says that if we lust after someone, we have committed adultery. Both this “murder” and this “adultery” are true on the level of being. They are actions that attempt to reduce the being of another. As such, they are actions of Satan, “the murderer from the beginning,” and the “father of lies.”<br><br>We also seek to kill ourselves throughout the day. In subtle ways and choices, we often make moves towars lesser being or even non-being itself. The false identities and consumer-based personalities that often fill our closets or inhabit our anxieties are not part of the path to the truth or the reality of being. When Christ says that He has come to “bring life, and that more abundantly,” He is pointing towards the fullness of being that is grounded in God Himself.<br><br>It is the nature of our modern culture that it constantly drives us to be what we are not or to become someone (or something) other than ourselves. The ground of our culture is the economy, while the ground of being human is communion with God. Christ is quite clear: “You cannot serve God and mammon (money).” The power of money, and its alure, is its ability to generate pleasure, and forestall pain, neither of which are sinful nor death-dealing in and of themselves. It is, however, the secular nature of the context in which they occur that make them harmful.<br><br>Christ said, “There is none good but God.” It is a grounding of the good, as it is the grounding of being as well. A plant that has been up-rooted dies. Human beings do as well, though the death is slow and takes a myriad of forms.<br><br>Our rooting in God (“in Him we live and move and have our being” Acts 17:28) is essential. The moral compass of a culture in which the Christian tradition is dominant is insufficient to give life. It is, however, of use in preventing a culture from spinning into worlds of death-dealing nonsense. For all intents and purposes, that compass has disappeared for the larger part of our culture purveyors. We are not only dying, but dying in increasingly bizarre ways.<br><br>The New Testament occasionally makes comments about “lawlessness.” St. John equates sin and lawlessness (1Jn 3:4). When our communion with God is disrupted, lawlessness is the result. That is to say, the inner law, the natural compass of our well-being, begins to malfunction. We lose our direction. Our actions (even intended “good” actions) can become corrupted and serve only to destroy our lives. That this takes place on a cultural level is deeply alarming. Historically, cultures serve as something of a hedge around our lives. They cannot make us good, but they encourage us towards the good and turn us away from evil. Today, this is decreasingly true.<br><br>God has given us more than the background of culture with its shifting laws and mores. He has primarily given us the Church, together with its Tradition, and the life of the sacraments. This is more than a protective “garment of skin” (as the Fathers sometimes described the protection of laws and customs). The Church makes possible our active grounding in the communion of life itself. This is the content of all of the sacraments and the basis for the whole reality of the Church. The canons and moral teachings serve the purpose of nurturing us in the true life of Christ (they are not mere laws of outward conformity).<br><br>This reality makes it utterly important that the voices who seek to change the Church’s teaching or discipline to conform it to modern cultural norms should be ignored and resisted. Our culture in no way reasons in accordance with our life in Christ. It is the whisper of death that is of a piece with the first lying whispers in the Garden.<br><br>Some time back I ran across an interview with Tom Holland, a non-Christian historian, who readily admits that our civilization is rooted in Christianity and is in great danger of losing that grounding. It is deeply honest and worth a listen if you’re interested. We often take for granted the stability of the culture (at least this was once the case). Today, the case for cultural change is not being driven by rebellious, seditious groups, but by the most powerful political, social, and corporate structures themselves. Not since the Protestant Reformation has such a sea-change been marketed from the “top down.”<br><br>I take consolation from two thoughts (and a few others). The Scriptures have this:<br><br>“Surely men of low degree are a vapor,<br>Men of high degree are a lie;<br>If they are weighed on the scales,<br>They are altogether lighter than vapor.” (Psalm 62:9)<br><br>And, famously, this:<br><br>“The voice said, “Cry out!”<br>And he said, “What shall I cry?”<br>“All flesh is grass,<br>And all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.<br>The grass withers, the flower fades,<br>Because the breath of the LORD blows upon it;<br>Surely the people are grass.<br>The grass withers, the flower fades,<br>But the word of our God stands forever.”” (Isaiah 40:6–8)<br><br>The life of God given to us in the Church abides forever. It is heard in His word. It is written in every rock and tree, every element and molecule of our body.<br><br>My prayer, “O Breath of God, blow in our world.

Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 12:59 pm<br>Dean,<br>Yes. It is the common way of portraying this in an icon. Icons are, above all, theological statements. They are not “ahistorical,” per se, but theology shapes the way icons are painted. They are “theology in color.” I suspect that we frequently misread Scripture by concentrating on historical questions (as if that settled anything). Scripture, filled with history, is also, primarily, a theological statement and should be read theologically. I would even go so far as to say that history itself is a theological statement. God is speaking to us in everything, everywhere, and always.<br><br>Salaam says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 2:39 pm<br>Thank you, Father.<br><br>Eric says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 4:21 pm<br>Amen!<br><br>Anna Sen says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 4:26 pm<br>I really love and am edified by your comments Father.<br>May God keep you well so you can speak His word to our souls and restore our lives towards His Kingdom.<br>Please keep my family and me in your prayers.<br>we are all suffering from dysfunction and sin .<br>anna .<br><br>Laura says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 4:38 pm<br>Thank you, Father Stephen.

What would become of civilization if the same powerful individuals carried on for hundreds, or thousands, or (as some of our wealthy opinionated suggest is their personal destiny) for endless time)? Death keeps the world alive.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 5:18 pm<br>Father, as a long time history buff, your statement that history is a theological statement is true because history is about the nature of mankind. When a different theology is in one’s heart history will be read, written abd interpreted differently. Even one’s own personal history will be different. At least that has been my experience.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 7:03 pm<br>Arnold,<br>If taken in the most literal sense. You are describing mere separation of the soul from the body. Some people die, though being very truly alive. Some people live while being very truly dead. That our years end as they do is said in Scriptures to be a mercy for us, though not saying that death is anything other than an enemy. But I would not posit a non-dying world filled with people in whom death (in its fullest meaning) was at work. It would simply be a world ever increasing in its evil.<br><br>Cliff says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 8:49 pm<br>Thanks Father! You have addressed an issue that I have been struggling with for some time. I have for the past few years been asking myself, “What should be my response to the powers and principalities that are encouraging non-being for all humanity?” I have felt that I should speak out against them, because of the connection between the Spirit of God and liberty. The West has for some time been deleting the work of God’s Spirit from the world. Our declining liberties are indicative of this, but the answer is not trying to reverse those liberties for ourselves. It is to reverse the deletion of God’s Spirit from a world that is quickly moving towards totalitarian rule.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 8:59 pm<br>Cliff,<br>I have presumed that the political fortunes of the world are in the hands of God: He causes the nations to rise and He causes the nations to fall. And though we live in systems we describe as “democratic,” that is less descriptive of what actually is the case. We are a large economic system, driven by economic forces. Both political parties are driven by various economic interests, far more than ideological. Often, any religious interests held by politicians are corrupting of religion far more often than being helpful.<br><br>For example, the studies I’ve seen show that abortion is about as common among Catholic, Orthodox, and Evangelicals as it is in the general population. We are not a “leavening” force – rather – we are being corrupted.<br><br>None of that is very encouraging. I’ve taken to reading very careful, well-researched and detailed histories of various periods. In the last couple of years I’ve read materials from 6th century Byzantium, the 14th and 15th centuries in England and France, and the 17th century in England. Basically, the first two were periods during which there were terrible plagues (and worse), and the last was the insanity of the English Civil War that was the seed-bed for all subsequent Protestantism in the West.<br><br>Reading them was a lesson in just how bad things can get (really, really bad), and a lesson in the fact that God is in charge of history, regardless. We are living in a terrible time that will likely become much worse. But, God is in charge and His providence will be triumphant.<br><br>It is for us to be as faithful as possible, to keep the commandments, to pray, and live a godly life. The outcome of history does not belong to us. What Christ has said is utterly sufficient.<br><br>Byron says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 11:13 pm<br>But I would not posit a non-dying world filled with people in whom death (in its fullest meaning) was at work. It would simply be a world ever increasing in its evil.<br><br>Is this not why Death was allowed to enter creation? So that we would not live eternally, increasing in evil?<br><br>Byron says:<br>October 28, 2022 at 11:30 pm<br>It is for us to be as faithful as possible, to keep the commandments, to pray, and live a godly life.<br><br>Father, pardon a possible sideslip, but I’ve recently come to the tentative conclusion that the Orthodox Mysteries (Sacraments), along with the practices of the Church (fasting, almsgiving, prayer, etc.) are what a life of repentance looks like. These things shape our hearts in God’s Holiness so His love can be seen in/through our lives. This is what your statement seems to mean (copied below, if I am understanding it correctly):<br><br>The Church makes possible our active grounding in the communion of life itself.<br><br>Please correct me if I am wrong. I’ve been considering how to concretely communicate or describe “repentance” so the term doesn’t hang vaporously in the air during any discussion and the Mysteries and practices of the Church came directly to mind.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 9:10 am<br>Byron,<br>The Scriptures and the Fathers seem to agree that death serves the purpose both of provoking repentance as well as limiting our capacity for evil.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 9:16 am<br>Byron,<br>The practices of the Church and the sacraments exist in order to serve our grounding in the life of God. They are part of a life of repentance. All of the sacraments, interestingly, presume prayer, fasting, turning from sin as we approach them.<br><br>Repentance (metanoia) is a “change of mind (nous)”. The nous is not so much the “thinking” part of the mind as it is the deep part (the heart). Its change implies a transformation of the whole person. No one “gets it right” all the time, or in a single moment. Thus the sacraments allow us to repeatedly bring ourselves to that place of transformation, to allow the life of God working within us to cleanse us, renew us, make us alive, etc. That, I think, is repentance.<br><br>Byron says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 12:00 pm<br>Thank you for those clarifications, Father!<br><br>Polly says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 12:02 pm<br>Father,<br><br>I often read your blog and have to admit that I am surprised by your outlook on our culture in this post. I have been encouraged by your resistance to engage in any sort of culture war—and yet this post seems to give up on our culture wholesale. While I see many faults in the culture of the United States, particularly the defining of oneself by possessions (a state of non-being), I personally find it more helpful to look for “whatever things are true” and focus on those. Perhaps what you are saying is that these “true” things can be perverted without a basis in Christ. Either way, I would find it hard to exist in our culture without the hopeful attitude of looking for the good.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Polly<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 12:24 pm<br>Polly,<br>I’m not interested in the culture wars, per se, primarily because I think that the two sides (including the one with which I would most easily identify) are both enmeshed in darkness. The culture, at least as it is exhibited by the “purveyors” of culture, is pretty much locked in darkness. It is why I consistently point people towards the local, towards the good that is at hand, towards the keeping of Christ’s commandments in the nearest possible manner. The cultural purveyors consistently seek to draw us away towards generalizations, abstractions, and various passions. They waste our time and only want our money.<br><br>I think that, given the fact that we are frequently living in front of tv’s, phones, and computers, we forget those things that are not “screened” to us. I do not think that we will find much goodness in those cultural products.<br><br>But the world is good and there are plenty of places to which we may attend to that goodness. You’re right in looking for it.<br><br>I’m not naive, however. In the cultural wars, people are losing jobs (several in my parish) as HR departments “cancel” those who refuse to go along with new ideological demands. When people start losing jobs, it’s more than an abstract culture war. In that I know many such people, as others do as well, I hope to encourage them. It’s important that acknowledge that something bad is going on and that it’s not likely to improve any time soon.<br><br>I spoke with a mother in my parish recently who told me about her middle schooler. In one school group they were in, fully 1/3 of the children were “identifying” as something other than their birth gender. This is not California, but Tennessee. That’s an absurd number with no possible grounding in a natural phenomenon. It’s a cultural artifact – and the rightly frightens parents who feel out of control as they watch their children become alien to them.<br><br>I do not major in such discussions for a variety of reasons – but I do not and cannot ignore them. I understand your point and can assure you that I’m not shifting the tone of my writing – but these things need to be mentioned from time to time.<br><br>I might also add that Christians have been in a culture war for 2,000 years. The problem today is that some think 1950 would represent a victory. It’s insufficient. But, there will never come a time when we will have “won” the great culture war – not before the coming of Christ. But we cannot make peace with what has been identified as a death-dealing mixture. The spiritual “trick” is to know how not to be consumed by the war but to be consumed by the Life of God.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 2:19 pm<br>Father, you said that a world full of living dead people would be one of ever increasing evil. I understand that. That awareness is one factor in trying to take up the work of repentance to learn who I really am no matter my age. However I know of instances where it seemed that the person dying is given a last chance to repent and become alive in death. So death is defeated at times even when it seems to win. The best weapon seems to be two fold: 1. Not fearing its illusory power and 2: Taking every opportunity to repent while still in this life so that our fantasy, fear and passion does not rule. The rest of the Christian life tends to follow if it is wanted. Is that close?<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 2:43 pm<br>Michael, yes, I think so.<br><br>Dee of St Herman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 4:15 pm<br>Father,<br>I’m grateful for your response to Polly. Sometimes I feel very embattled and have to work hard against despair regarding authentically living the life of Christ. I sincerely believe your vision of this culture is accurate and observes the machinations of this culture in its global context through the eyes of Christ. The only good in this world is that which has been received from Christ.<br><br>One trend of late is the “minimalism” lifestyle. Admittedly I’ve been watching YouTube videos about it on occasion, aware that I’m participating in the reception of the messaging of the “purveyors of culture” you describe. On the surface, it seems to suggest the ways of Christ. However, on closer look, it seems to not curtail acquisition but to offload what you liked and purchased last week but like less this week and will replace once you have off-loaded. It appears to subvert the mindset of anti-mammon with a quasi-anti-accumulation mindset. But on occasion, when it seems anti-materialistic, it also appears to have a ring of emptiness, a hollowness without Christ.<br><br>I recognize a tendency in myself to accumulate, which is a form of acquisition. And it often takes the form of ‘more information or ‘more knowledge’ as if they were objects to acquire. (Deep irony that it often takes the form of goofing off on YouTube– baby videos, kitty or puppy videos, housecleaning videos, etc) But we cannot acquire God. And acquiring book knowledge of theology is not acquiring God. The authentic life in Christ is received, not achieved. Life in Christ is a life in the constant prayer of worship and love of Christ. May God help us to seek communion with Him.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>October 29, 2022 at 4:38 pm<br>Dee, my wife and I share bit of the acquisitive spirit that you describe. My brother has a fried who joins “alternative communities” on a regular basis until she finds something that is not ‘right’ .<br><br>My brother says it is the lack of the Sacraments she is missing. A sobering realization. Thank you for sharing.<br><br>Lynda O says:<br>October 30, 2022 at 7:45 pm<br>Thanks for this post, Father Stephen, it’s the encouragement I needed today.

Life in Christ is a life in the constant prayer of worship and love of Christ.<br><br>Such a good comment, Dee! Thanks for this!<br><br>Drewster2000 says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 1:10 pm<br>Fr. Stephen,<br><br>I also take consolation in the fact that the way we’re wired doesn’t ever really get changed by external forces. While people are mistakenly “identifying” right and left these days, these are just events, fads and fireworks that look wonderful and shiny tonight but won’t be so pretty the next morning. When that happens, people are “pre-programmed” (for lack of a better phrase) to do things like cry out to their God, look for love & acceptance, and so on.<br><br>When the chips are down, people – often without any thought involve – operate on their deepest instincts, and those are still uncorrupted. How they act on them can go a number of ways, but the true, primal desires are still the ones God gave us at the beginning. This gives me a lot of hope, because Jesus taught us how to meet these. And for many things, it doesn’t take a specialist. Food for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and love for all, etc.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 1:41 pm<br>Drewster,<br>I think that had we no predisposition towards the good (towards God), it would be impossible to be saved. That’s why the total depravity people also teach a predestination. It’s a theology for puppets. But we are free – created for God – created for love – created for freedom. Christ fulfills the aching, longing heart.<br><br>Dean says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 1:45 pm<br>Good thoughts Drewster,<br>BTW, This morning I saw a pic of 96 yr old Dick Van Dyck. He had just bought lots of new coats and was loading them into his car. He then was driving to deliver them to folks who need them.<br>Heart warming for me to see. Doing the next good thing.<br><br>Drewster2000 says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 1:54 pm<br>Fr. Stephen: I totally agree. Your statement should be totally obvious and not NEED to be stated. But in the smog we inhabit, that’s not the case.<br><br>Dean: Heartwarming, indeed. This is the immediate good Fr. Stephen often refers to. I think the temptation is to want to see the impact of our good acts and a hint that the weather is changing, but that’s above our paygrade. We must look to Him for all things and simply continue to be like Him in every way we can, kudos or no.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 2:18 pm<br>Ah, Drewster… The desire for kudos….<br>Lord, forgive me<br><br>Luke Nieuwsma says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 7:02 pm<br>Fr, your post and the comments below remind me of what several of the holy Greek elders from the past century said: that the services of the Church themselves are a spiritual university… that everyone should spend some time at a monastery (if possible) to immerse themselves in Christ and His healing.<br>If we really orient ourselves around the fasts and feasts of the Church and toward pursuing communion with the Saints and with our dear Lord, that by itself will start to produce a healthy culture (way of daily living) among the Faithful. Father Seraphim Rose of blessed memory heavily underscored this point as well: life immersed within the Life of the Church, instead of being heavily seasoned by modern American society.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>October 31, 2022 at 9:42 pm<br>Father and Drewster, it is just what I see myself and, unfortunately, others do with my God given freedom … The only viable solution I have ever been shown is repentance which has the side effect of making everybody else look a lot better and it easier to thank God and live closer to joy and peace. In repentance enter the Kingdom of God Matthew 4:17. Even if is just a small taste and for a short while.<br>Of course in getting there we also share in The Cross. Since I do not know what I am doing.<br><br>Nikolaos says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 4:37 am<br>Father<br><br>Regarding your comment on freedom (“ But we are free – created for God – created for love – created for freedom.).<br><br>Modern culture stresses the importance of “freedom” in many aspects, freedom from occupation, freedom of speech etc.<br><br>Is it correct that the Orthodox mindset is that man is not free in the absolute sense, as we are created, we die and we are therefore not free. What we have been endowed with, however, is “free will”, we can chose to repent, we can chose to follow Christ’s commandments and potentially share His freedom by grace.<br><br>I feel more comfortable in the idea of free will than the idea of freedom.<br><br>Mark Spurlock says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 8:50 am<br>Coincidentally, I was listening to Kallistos Ware give a talk on Divine Compassion and Restoring the Human Icon on my drive in this morning, and he spoke extensively about freedom as being part of how we are made in the image of God. Rather than summarize, I’ll quote from it:<br><br>As God is free, so the human person in God’s image is free. God’s freedom is absolute and unrestricted; human freedom is relative, and limited by heredity, upbringing, and by outward circumstances. Yet, there is a genuine analogy between the two levels of freedom. In the words of St. Maximos the Confessor, “If the human being is created in the image of the loving and supra-essential Godhead, then since the Godhead is liberty, this signifies that the human being as God’s image is also liberty. Equally it is said in the Macarian homilies, “Heaven, sun, moon, and earth have no free will, but you are in the image and likeness of God. Because just as God is his own master and does whatever He wishes, so you, also, are your own master; and if you so choose, you can destroy yourself.” Reflecting on the Divine image, let us call to mind the words of Soren Kierkegaard. “The most tremendous thing granted to human beings is choice, freedom.”<br><br>…Freedom is a precious gift from God, but it also demands sacrifice; and it can even prove tragic. In the words of the Russian philosopher, Nicholas Berdyaev, “I always knew that freedom gives birth to suffering, while the refusal to be free diminishes suffering.”<br><br>[End quote] He goes on to say that to renounce freedom is to reject the Divine image within us and to deny others their freedom is to dehumanize them.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 11:14 am<br>Mark thank you. You and Met Kallistos ate spot on. I am going to expand on it, I hope, by looking at the other side.<br><br>From my senior year in high school through my senior year in college I got to study the philosophy of “The Will” especially Hegel and Nietzsche and a US “Great Man” Andrew Jackson who lived by the power of “free will”<br>The philosophy of free will and choice is a lie. It is the superstructure for tyranny, greed (shopping), debauchery and killing–all revolt against God personally and corporately.<br>It is the Satanic lie in the Garden writ large.<br>When I recognize the Incarnate Lord and submit to His mercy it is not a choice. It is simply a recognition of who I am and who God is. The Holy Trinity is three Persons (not three ideas). My personhood is because I am created in His image. Once I realized that I look at God, I look at me and recognize my deficiency. Repentance becomes both possible and much easier. A bit like breathing.<br>In our culture, founded on the human will, repentance is always a consumer/political choice–which makes it nothing.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 1:52 pm<br>Nikolaos,<br>It’s an interesting question. Obviously, we are “contingent” – meaning, there is a “necessity” in our lives that is, in a manner of speaking, inescapable. And whatever “freedom” we have is never a freedom that is self-existing. Only God is self-existing. And, even in God, though we don’t call it necessity, the Father is “Father” in that He begets the Son, and the Son is “Son,” in that He is begotten of the Father, etc.<br><br>The freedom for which we are created (found in Gal. 5:1) is true freedom, but not a self-referential freedom. We are free to exist in love – which must be free and must be given as a gift, not as a demand. So, it is true freedom.<br><br>We have, it is said, “free will,” though I’m slightly skeptical about it – in that as broken sinners, we rarely experience our choosing in a truly free manner. The best way to begin the healing of the will is to freely give thanks – always, everywhere, and for all things.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 3:36 pm<br>Father giving thanks always for all things always and every where is only real if 1. We are created radically free as a state of being by a 2. Loving and omnipotent God who is a Person (in our case 3 Persons) rather than a force, energy or Cosmic Will, that involves choice, etc. As free beings created in the image we are automatically interrelated.<br>Such a Creator also sees to it that repentance is an integral part of our freedom.<br><br>Or am I off the mark?<br><br>Dino says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 4:49 pm<br>I often think that the crux of the matter, regarding the most foundational gift of free will in man, is that it is given to us to freely self-determine towards our God.<br>Everything springs forth from that foundational inner inclination.<br>The various “soils” of our hearts’ ground, described in the parable of the sower, even the varying fecundity of the “good soil” are predicated chiefly upon this inner, freely-determined inclination towards our Maker, irrespective even of circumstance.<br>There are of course extremely trying circumstances, but these are just difficult “tests”.<br><br>Fr. Stephen Freeman says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 5:30 pm<br>Michael,<br>Can’t get my mind to work this afternoon.<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 6:43 pm<br>Father that is me most days. But I was driving home from the store and I got to thinking about the difference between giving praise because I am pleased with the outcome (as in free will) or just because I am made in the image of God and it is an integral part of my being (all things are sent by God) except my “free will” messed it up and I can only give thanks for those things that I like or please me. I have been working on it awhile and last night when I could not sleep because of constant pain there were a couple of passing moments when I came close to giving thanks. Repentance in thanks giving was as close as I came.<br>Long way to go<br><br>Margaret says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 7:29 pm<br>Father, forgive me, but when I think about giving praise and thinking about free will and also consider becoming as a little child, I think of the GK Chesterton quote “Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, “Do it again”; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening, “Do it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.”― G. K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy<br><br>Michael Bauman says:<br>November 1, 2022 at 7:41 pm<br>“This is the day the Lord has made.
