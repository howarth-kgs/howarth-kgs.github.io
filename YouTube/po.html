But what if, when it comes to my citizenship, I actually am a fraud? For those unfamiliar with the term, impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern that causes an individual to doubt their skills, talents or accomplishments and to have a persistent internalised fear of being exposed as a “fraud.”<br><br>This feeling is amplified each time I travel and a customs officer says “obrigada” to me as I hand over my Portuguese passport at the airport. I don’t speak Portuguese, nor do I identify with the culture. I’m not married to a Portuguese national, nor have I ever lived in the country in my 30 years of existence. So how come I was allowed to become a Portuguese citizen in 2017?<br><br>I am one of the tens of thousands of Indians to apply for citizenship under a Portuguese law that offers a fast track to citizenship for residents of the state of Goa and the coastal towns of Daman and Diu, on the west coast of India. The law applies only to those who were born before the liberation of the region in December 1961. Unlike other colonial-era immigration policies, this loophole law is enshrined in the Portuguese Constitution and even allows Indians from two generations after colonial rule to opt for Portuguese nationality.<br><br>When life gives you lemons<br>My path to EU citizenship has been easier than that of most. My mother’s ancestors just happened to come from a tiny region in Goa that the Portuguese did not cede to the British Crown. Decades later, this made me eligible to apply for Portuguese citizenship.<br><br>I was one of the few people in my circle in India who didn’t want a career in tech or science. Instead, I wanted to be foreign correspondent and explore the unfamiliar. EU citizenship would save me the hassle and expense of constantly applying for visas.<br><br>In total, it took me over three years to obtain my Portuguese passport. My mother and I spent the first two years digging into the archives of Goan churches and combing through tattered paper files written in Portuguese from the early 1800s to prove that my grandparents were born, and lived, in Portuguese Goa.<br><br>The upside to this painstaking process was the discovery of a lost family history. I found out that my grandfather was originally named Patrocinio, and only later anglicised it to Patrick, and that the fondness for numbers in my family might be explained by the fact that my great grandfather was an accountant.<br><br>After sending all the paperwork linking three generations of my family to the lawyers in Portugal, it was time to officially become a citizen. In March 2017, I flew into Lisbon as an Indian citizen and left the country as a Portuguese one a few days later.<br><br>The number of people acquiring citizenship in this way has risen sharply in recent years. According to the Borders and Asylum Report (RIFA), more than 74,000 foreign citizens applied for Portuguese nationality in 2019—the highest number in the last five years. Almost a third of those came from Brazil, another former Portuguese colony.<br><br>A better life<br>Although I have never lived under colonial rule, its effects did leave a mark on my ancestors and have been passed down through the generations, resulting in the amalgamation of my identity.<br><br>I’m aware of the harm done by colonisation to my ancestors, such as the Goan Inquisition, a long and bloody period of persecution of non-Catholic people. But I have to admit that, although my colonial heritage made me stand out as “too Western” in India, it helps me fit in easily overseas.<br><br>The benefits of the cultural legacy left behind by the Portuguese settlers are also enumerated by Stella Mascarenhas-Keyes, the first Goan social anthropologist to focus a PhD on Goan international migration in her book Colonialism, Migration and the International Catholic Goan Community.<br><br>“Goans chanced on migration because of the cultures they inherited from Portuguese rule in Goa and the conversion to Catholicism. This made Goa a more open-minded society with respect to trading alcohol and eating beef and pork. It also made it easier for Goans to be employed anywhere in the world,” she said.<br><br>Growing up, I was too Western for an Indian. Since moving abroad, I have felt too Indian for the West.<br><br>Knowing that I would always be caught in the middle of these two identities, I do not regret moving abroad. Although I miss home, I have to acknowledge that, in a way, colonialism has enabled me to live the “better life.”<br><br><br>Amanda Peters's motivation<br>Since moving to Europe, I have had many conversations and much introspection regarding immigration, identity and the thought of “finding your tribe.” This piece is a culmination of those thoughts. It has almost become a ritual of mine to assess whether this move was worth the effort and writing about it helps to make sense of the intangible.<br><br>Illustration by<br>Eddie Stok<br>©2022 Are We Europe<br>PAN-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE OF BORDER-BREAKING STORIES<br> Facebook-f Twitter Youtube<br>About Are We Europe<br>Contact<br>FAQ<br>Legal<br>Stockists<br>Awe Studio<br>Want to discover the stories that shape our continent?<br>Join over 500 members rethinking the future of European storytelling!

Said they were forbidden by Geneva convention. At least in WW I and WW II. I carried one as my weapon of choice for shipboard defense. Here is the skinny. Not banned but definitely and attention getter.<br><br>As numerous folks have commented- use of the shotgun is not a violation of the Hague Convention. The rumor that it is stems from WWI The US was issuing the Winchester M1897 pump shotgun for use as a “ trench broom” in the hand to hand combat that was part and parcel of assaulting and over running a defended trench line. 12 gauge buckshot at the max range of 10 meters or so, from a gun that could be fired 3 times in 2 seconds ( much faster than the bolt action rifles of German defenders) was absolutely devastating .German soldiers feared the Winchester and the Germans protested to the Haugue Convention commission claiming the shotgun was a violation. The Convention Commission quickly ruled that shotgun use was not a violation. The Germans, not willing to let the issue drop, publicly announced the policy that every American armed with a shotgun would be summarily shot on capture. American Commander General “”Black Jack” Pershing would have none of that- he countered that any German caught carrying the ( very useful and widely used) sawtooth pioneer bayonet would be shot. That pretty much ended the matter. Shotguns were used in WWII and Korea mostly for security and military police duties. In Vietnam they were used in jungle fighting at close range and in urban combat. They were also used the “Tunnel Rats” who entered enemy tunnel complexes to map and demolish them. Shotguns ( Mossberg 500 series primarily) continue to be used in such roles today- house clearing, security work, POW guard missions as well as naval boarding and inspection parties.<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies<br>Caught on camera: 80-year-old Norco store owner shoots attempted robbery suspect<br>8/2/2022, 9:44:51 PM · 7 of 28<br>ping jockey to ping jockey<br>Congress is so stupid when it comes to weapons.

The Sberbank of Russia is probably the most dominant bank offering unallocated Metal Accounts but as one does not have actual ownership of the gold in these accounts but simply ‘share’ the gold, this is not recommended as banks and governments have a habit of using the assets of others in times of need.

The 4 largest gold mines in Russia produce nearly 40% of the annual Russian gold production.<br><br>For the past three years Russia has also been buying gold at a rate of 10.2 tonnes per month. This is an incredible amount of gold and gives rise to speculation that Russia is thinking in terms of gold being used to back its currency.<br>In fact, Russia has also been a proponent of gold being included in a new world currency basket based on special drawing rights issued by the IMF. Alexei Ulyukayev, CBRs first Deputy Chairman not long ago stated that “for Russia gold will always be a natural quality asset.”Bloomberg 3rd March 2010. And this is demonstrated with the CBR (Central Bank of Russia) showing a preference for gold in the management of its reserves.

Between 2014 and 2017, his LinkedIn profile notes, he worked for both the CIA and FBI, authored dozens of official reports, some of which were read by President Barack Obama. Carlton describes his role as a “problem-solver” and claims to have worked in many “dynamic, high-pressure environments” such as Iraq and Korea. In May 2021, he left official service to become a senior program manager at Twitter, responsible for dealing with the company’s “highest-profile trust and safety escalations.”<br><br>Other former FBI staff are employed by Twitter, such as Cherrelle Y. as a policy domain specialist and Laura D. as a senior analyst in global risk intelligence.<br><br>Many of those listed above were active in the FBI’s public outreach programs, a practice sold as a community trust-building initiative. According to Rowley, however, these also function as “ways for officials to meet the important people that would give them jobs after retirement.” “It basically inserts a huge conflict of interest,” she told MintPress. “It warps and perverts the criminal investigative work that agents do when they are still working as agents because they anticipate getting lucrative jobs after retiring or leaving the FBI.”<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 23 | View Replies<br>Latest ‘Twitter Files’ Reveal Secret Suppression of Right-Wing Commentators<br>12/9/2022, 11:11:06 AM · 23 of 39<br>tired&retired to tired&retired<br>“Per the article:<br><br>“For example, in 2019, Dawn Burton (the former director of Washington operations for Lockheed Martin) was poached from her job as senior innovation advisor to the director at the FBI to become senior director of strategy and operations for legal, public policy, trust and safety at Twitter. The following year, Karen Walsh went straight from 21 years at the bureau to become director of corporate resilience at the silicon valley giant. Twitter’s deputy general counsel and vice president of legal, Jim Baker, also spent four years at the FBI between 2014 and 2018, where his resumé notes he rose to the role of senior strategic advisor.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mark Jaroszewski ended his 21-year posting as a supervisory special agent in the Bay Area to take up a position at Twitter, rising to become director of corporate security and risk. And Douglas Turner spent 14 years as a senior special agent and SWAT Team leader before being recruited to serve in Twitter’s corporate and executive security services. Previously, Turner had also spent seven years as a secret service special agent with the Department of Homeland Security.<br><br>When asked to comment by MintPress, former FBI agent and whistleblower Coleen Rowley said that she was “not surprised at all” to see FBI agents now working for the very tech companies the agency polices, stating that there now exists a “revolving door” between the FBI and the areas they are trying to regulate. This created a serious conflict of interests in her mind, as many agents have one eye on post-retirement jobs. “The truth is that at the FBI 50% of all the normal conversations that people had were about how you were going to make money after retirement,” she said.<br><br>Many former FBI officials hold influential roles within Twitter. For instance, in 2020, Matthew W. left a 15-year career as an intelligence program manager at the FBI to take up the post of senior director of product trust at Twitter. Patrick G., a 23-year FBI supervisory special agent, is now head of corporate security. And Twitter’s director of insider risk and security investigations, Bruce A., was headhunted from his role as a supervisory special agent at the bureau. His resumé notes that at the FBI he held “[v]arious intelligence and law enforcement roles in the US, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East” and was a “human intelligence and counterintelligence regional specialist.”<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 21 | View Replies<br>Latest ‘Twitter Files’ Reveal Secret Suppression of Right-Wing Commentators<br>12/9/2022, 11:05:50 AM · 22 of 39<br>tired&retired to tired&retired<br>TWITTER IS HIRING AN ALARMING NUMBER OF FBI AGENTS<br><br>The social media giant’s recruitment drive among federal agents is just one sign of a growing “revolving door” between the FBI and the entities it seeks to regulate.<br><br>BY ALAN MACLEOD, MPN.NEWS<br>JULY 14, 2022<br><br>https://therealnews.com/twitter-is-hiring-an-alarming-number-of-fbi-agents<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 21 | View Replies<br>Latest ‘Twitter Files’ Reveal Secret Suppression of Right-Wing Commentators<br>12/9/2022, 10:58:14 AM · 21 of 39<br>tired&retired to nickcarraway<br>And what are we going to do about it?<br><br>(Really funny reply by Jim Carey in Liar, Liar.)<br><br>https://youtu.be/wk7fYBw6PfQ<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies<br>New Discovery Could Explain Why We've Been Misled Over The Cause of Alzheimer's<br>12/7/2022, 6:37:21 PM · 4 of 16<br>tired&retired to tired&retired<br>Sorry, mis copied the link<br><br>https://youtu.be/WLxbTIQ8cqo<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies<br>New Discovery Could Explain Why We've Been Misled Over The Cause of Alzheimer's<br>12/7/2022, 6:36:32 PM · 3 of 16<br>tired&retired to tired&retired<br>https://youtu.be/WLxbTI<br>Q8cqo<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies<br>New Discovery Could Explain Why We've Been Misled Over The Cause of Alzheimer's<br>12/7/2022, 6:35:01 PM · 2 of 16<br>tired&retired to tired&retired<br>The team found that high levels of PLD3 occasionally led to lysosome enlargement even in healthy mice.

One study of 29,000 male smokers found an 18% increase in lung cancer in the group receiving 20 mg of beta-carotene a day for 5 to 8 years. Another study of 18,000 people found 28% more lung cancers in people with a history of smoking and/or asbestos exposure. These people took 30 mg of beta-carotene in addition to 25,000 Units of retinol (a form of vitamin A) a day for 4 years.<br><br>However, one study of 22,000 male physicians, some of them smokers or former smokers, found no increase in lung cancer. These people took 50 mg of beta-carotene every other day for 12 years. If you smoke or have a history of smoking or asbestos exposure, you should not take large amounts of beta-carotene supplements for long periods of time. However, foods that are rich in beta-carotene are considered safe and appear to lower the risk of some types of cancer and possibly heart disease.”<br><br>Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies<br>Next PageRSS	 	<br>Browse by Forum<br>Bloggers & Personal	Topics	Post<br>General/Chat	Topics	Post<br>GOP Club	Topics	Post<br>News/Activism	Topics	Post<br>Religion	Topics	Post<br>RLC Liberty Caucus	Topics	Post<br>Smoky Backroom	Topics	Post<br>VetsCoR	Topics	Post<br>Everything	 	 <br>Get Connected!
