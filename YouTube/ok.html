You can reach me by e-mail at abe.970@gmail.com<br><br>My rate is a sliding scale $20-$100/hour. Here are some guidelines if you are unsure what to charge me:<br><br><br>$45/hour First Hour -- Identify Problem.<br><br>Logically attempted solution, but it has not worked. Attempted web search about problem. Looked at https://www.quora.com/ and https://www.youtube.com/ for solution. Attempted to implement solutions discovered on web. Went past first page of search results. Went into Settings, but we were afraid of changing things. Do not think it is a virus. Use your imagination.<br><br><br>$60/hour Second Hour -- Begin Troubleshooting.<br><br>Decided not to ask friends or online help. We are going to figure this out ourselves. Began to wonder if the nature of our problem is different than anticipated. Began to use logic again and realized that many of our attempted solutions have already been attempted and have not resulted in the answer we want to our problem. Even began wondering if our problem is real. Aha! Let's try some new search terms in our web search. Began down new pathways not attempted yet, and still no answer.<br><br><br>$85/hour Third Hour -- Hardware Issues.<br><br>Realized the issue is a faulty component of the technology. We need to replace hardware! For these cases, I need to order a part for which you will be charged, so it will take time to fix.<br><br><br>$100/hour Fourth Hour -- Software Issues.<br><br>Went back through and identified problem as being software not hardware. Went through many, many pages of online help. Dug deeper into web search, trying many different new search terms, looking further down the pages of search results. Even looked at https://stackoverflow.com/ looking for an advanced solution. Usually in this case it is something basic, so I can help by going into Settings and changing things, or (for laptops and Desktop computers) writing some commands with the Command Prompt in Windows or the Terminal in Apple and Linux. Fortunately, in these cases no hardware needs to be replaced and things should be back to normal quickly.<br><br><br>Copy and Paste for mobile -- either double-tap or do a long tap on the text you want to select, then select the text you want, then remove your finger and a menu will come up, select "Copy". Then go to where you want to put the copied text, then either double-tap or do a long tap, a menu will come up, select "Paste".<br><br><br><br>If it takes me additional time to figure out the code to write to fix your problem, I will not bill you for the time I am learning new code.<br><br>Experience<br>CASCADIA CHAPTER OF NACUSA (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMPOSERS/USA) Graphic<br>Webmaster<br>CASCADIA CHAPTER OF NACUSA (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMPOSERS/USA)<br>Mar 2020 - Present2 years 2 months<br><br>Portland, Oregon, United States<br><br>I am a volunteer who updates the website using Wordpress with Divi theme.<br><br>Wyzant Graphic<br>Java Tutor<br>Wyzant<br>Sep 2016 - Jun 20181 year 10 months<br><br>Greater Seattle Area<br><br>My student Kate, who I tutored seven times, said I was "Attentive and helpful" and said, "Abraham made sure he understood exactly what kind of help I needed.
