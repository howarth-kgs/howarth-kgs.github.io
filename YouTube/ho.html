<tr align="top"><td class="c s2em fTNR bgReadingOrange" colspan="2">https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/user-defined-exception<BR><BR>Programiz<br><br>Search Programiz<br><br><br>Python Custom Exceptions<br>In this tutorial, you will learn how to define custom exceptions depending upon your requirements with the help of examples.<br><br>Python has numerous built-in exceptions that force your program to output an error when something in the program goes wrong.<br><br>However, sometimes you may need to create your own custom exceptions that serve your purpose.<br><br>Creating Custom Exceptions<br>In Python, users can define custom exceptions by creating a new class. This exception class has to be derived, either directly or indirectly, from the built-in Exception class. Most of the built-in exceptions are also derived from this class.<br><br>>>> class CustomError(Exception):<br>...     pass<br>...<br><br>>>> raise CustomError<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>...<br>__main__.CustomError<br><br>>>> raise CustomError("An error occurred")<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>...<br>__main__.CustomError: An error occurred<br>Here, we have created a user-defined exception called CustomError which inherits from the Exception class. This new exception, like other exceptions, can be raised using the raise statement with an optional error message.<br><br>When we are developing a large Python program, it is a good practice to place all the user-defined exceptions that our program raises in a separate file. Many standard modules do this. They define their exceptions separately as exceptions.py or errors.py (generally but not always).<br><br>User-defined exception class can implement everything a normal class can do, but we generally make them simple and concise. Most implementations declare a custom base class and derive others exception classes from this base class. This concept is made clearer in the following example.<br><br>Example: User-Defined Exception in Python<br>In this example, we will illustrate how user-defined exceptions can be used in a program to raise and catch errors.<br><br>This program will ask the user to enter a number until they guess a stored number correctly. To help them figure it out, a hint is provided whether their guess is greater than or less than the stored number.<br><br># define Python user-defined exceptions<br>class Error(Exception):<br>    """Base class for other exceptions"""<br>    pass<br><br><br>class ValueTooSmallError(Error):<br>    """Raised when the input value is too small"""<br>    pass<br><br><br>class ValueTooLargeError(Error):<br>    """Raised when the input value is too large"""<br>    pass<br><br><br># you need to guess this number<br>number = 10<br><br># user guesses a number until he/she gets it right<br>while True:<br>    try:<br>        i_num = int(input("Enter a number: "))<br>        if i_num < number:<br>            raise ValueTooSmallError<br>        elif i_num > number:<br>            raise ValueTooLargeError<br>        break<br>    except ValueTooSmallError:<br>        print("This value is too small, try again!")<br>        print()<br>    except ValueTooLargeError:<br>        print("This value is too large, try again!")<br>        print()<br><br>print("Congratulations! You guessed it correctly.")<br>Here is a sample run of this program.<br><br>Enter a number: 12<br>This value is too large, try again!<br><br>Enter a number: 0<br>This value is too small, try again!<br><br>Enter a number: 8<br>This value is too small, try again!<br><br>Enter a number: 10<br>Congratulations! You guessed it correctly.<br>We have defined a base class called Error.<br><br>The other two exceptions (ValueTooSmallError and ValueTooLargeError) that are actually raised by our program are derived from this class. This is the standard way to define user-defined exceptions in Python programming, but you are not limited to this way only.<br><br>Customizing Exception Classes<br>We can further customize this class to accept other arguments as per our needs.<br><br>To learn about customizing the Exception classes, you need to have the basic knowledge of Object-Oriented programming.<br><br>Visit Python Object Oriented Programming to start learning about Object-Oriented programming in Python.<br><br>Let's look at one example:<br><br>class SalaryNotInRangeError(Exception):<br>    """Exception raised for errors in the input salary.<br><br>    Attributes:<br>        salary -- input salary which caused the error<br>        message -- explanation of the error<br>    """<br><br>    def __init__(self, salary, message="Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range"):<br>        self.salary = salary<br>        self.message = message<br>        super().__init__(self.message)<br><br><br>salary = int(input("Enter salary amount: "))<br>if not 5000 < salary < 15000:<br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>Output<br><br>Enter salary amount: 2000<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "<string>", line 17, in <module><br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>__main__.SalaryNotInRangeError: Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range<br>Here, we have overridden the constructor of the Exception class to accept our own custom arguments salary and message. Then, the constructor of the parent Exception class is called manually with the self.message argument using super().<br><br>The custom self.salary attribute is defined to be used later.<br><br>The inherited __str__ method of the Exception class is then used to display the corresponding message when SalaryNotInRangeError is raised.<br><br>We can also customize the __str__ method itself by overriding it.<br><br>class SalaryNotInRangeError(Exception):<br>    """Exception raised for errors in the input salary.<br><br>    Attributes:<br>        salary -- input salary which caused the error<br>        message -- explanation of the error<br>    """<br><br>    def __init__(self, salary, message="Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range"):<br>        self.salary = salary<br>        self.message = message<br>        super().__init__(self.message)<br><br>    def __str__(self):<br>        return f'{self.salary} -> {self.message}'<br><br><br>salary = int(input("Enter salary amount: "))<br>if not 5000 < salary < 15000:<br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>Output<br><br>Enter salary amount: 2000<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "/home/bsoyuj/Desktop/Untitled-1.py", line 20, in <module><br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>__main__.SalaryNotInRangeError: 2000 -> Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range<br>To learn more about how you can handle exceptions in Python, visit Python Exception Handling.<br><br>Previous Tutorial:<br>Exception Handling<br>Next Tutorial:<br>Python OOP<br>Share on:<br>Did you find this article helpful?<br>Related Tutorials<br>Python Tutorial<br><br>Python Exception Handling Using try, except and finally statement<br><br>Python Tutorial<br><br>Python Errors and Built-in Exceptions<br><br>Python Library<br><br>Python Dictionary get()<br><br>Python Library<br><br>Python List sort()<br><br><br>Get Python App<br><br><br>Join our newsletter for the latest updates.<br>Enter Email Address*<br>Join<br>Tutorials<br>Python 3 Tutorial<br>JavaScript Tutorial<br>C Tutorial<br>Java Tutorial<br>Kotlin Tutorial<br>C++ Tutorial<br>Swift Tutorial<br>C# Tutorial<br>DSA Tutorial<br>Examples<br>Python Examples<br>JavaScript Examples<br>C Examples<br>Java Examples<br>Kotlin Examples<br>C++ Examples<br>Company<br>About<br>Advertising<br>Privacy Policy<br>Terms & Conditions<br>Contact<br>Blog<br>Youtube<br>Apps<br>Learn Python<br>Learn C Programming<br>Learn Java<br><br><br><br>© Parewa Labs Pvt.

Most of the built-in exceptions are also derived from this class.<br><br>>>> class CustomError(Exception):<br>...     pass<br>...<br><br>>>> raise CustomError<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>...<br>__main__.CustomError<br><br>>>> raise CustomError("An error occurred")<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>...<br>__main__.CustomError: An error occurred<br>Here, we have created a user-defined exception called CustomError which inherits from the Exception class. This new exception, like other exceptions, can be raised using the raise statement with an optional error message.<br><br>When we are developing a large Python program, it is a good practice to place all the user-defined exceptions that our program raises in a separate file. Many standard modules do this. They define their exceptions separately as exceptions.py or errors.py (generally but not always).<br><br>User-defined exception class can implement everything a normal class can do, but we generally make them simple and concise. Most implementations declare a custom base class and derive others exception classes from this base class. This concept is made clearer in the following example.<br><br>Example: User-Defined Exception in Python<br>In this example, we will illustrate how user-defined exceptions can be used in a program to raise and catch errors.<br><br>This program will ask the user to enter a number until they guess a stored number correctly. To help them figure it out, a hint is provided whether their guess is greater than or less than the stored number.<br><br># define Python user-defined exceptions<br>class Error(Exception):<br>    """Base class for other exceptions"""<br>    pass<br><br><br>class ValueTooSmallError(Error):<br>    """Raised when the input value is too small"""<br>    pass<br><br><br>class ValueTooLargeError(Error):<br>    """Raised when the input value is too large"""<br>    pass<br><br><br># you need to guess this number<br>number = 10<br><br># user guesses a number until he/she gets it right<br>while True:<br>    try:<br>        i_num = int(input("Enter a number: "))<br>        if i_num < number:<br>            raise ValueTooSmallError<br>        elif i_num > number:<br>            raise ValueTooLargeError<br>        break<br>    except ValueTooSmallError:<br>        print("This value is too small, try again!")<br>        print()<br>    except ValueTooLargeError:<br>        print("This value is too large, try again!")<br>        print()<br><br>print("Congratulations! You guessed it correctly.")<br>Here is a sample run of this program.<br><br>Enter a number: 12<br>This value is too large, try again!<br><br>Enter a number: 0<br>This value is too small, try again!<br><br>Enter a number: 8<br>This value is too small, try again!<br><br>Enter a number: 10<br>Congratulations! You guessed it correctly.<br>We have defined a base class called Error.<br><br>The other two exceptions (ValueTooSmallError and ValueTooLargeError) that are actually raised by our program are derived from this class. This is the standard way to define user-defined exceptions in Python programming, but you are not limited to this way only.<br><br>Customizing Exception Classes<br>We can further customize this class to accept other arguments as per our needs.<br><br>To learn about customizing the Exception classes, you need to have the basic knowledge of Object-Oriented programming.<br><br>Visit Python Object Oriented Programming to start learning about Object-Oriented programming in Python.<br><br>Let's look at one example:<br><br>class SalaryNotInRangeError(Exception):<br>    """Exception raised for errors in the input salary.<br><br>    Attributes:<br>        salary -- input salary which caused the error<br>        message -- explanation of the error<br>    """<br><br>    def __init__(self, salary, message="Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range"):<br>        self.salary = salary<br>        self.message = message<br>        super().__init__(self.message)<br><br><br>salary = int(input("Enter salary amount: "))<br>if not 5000 < salary < 15000:<br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>Output<br><br>Enter salary amount: 2000<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "<string>", line 17, in <module><br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>__main__.SalaryNotInRangeError: Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range<br>Here, we have overridden the constructor of the Exception class to accept our own custom arguments salary and message. Then, the constructor of the parent Exception class is called manually with the self.message argument using super().<br><br>The custom self.salary attribute is defined to be used later.<br><br>The inherited __str__ method of the Exception class is then used to display the corresponding message when SalaryNotInRangeError is raised.<br><br>We can also customize the __str__ method itself by overriding it.<br><br>class SalaryNotInRangeError(Exception):<br>    """Exception raised for errors in the input salary.<br><br>    Attributes:<br>        salary -- input salary which caused the error<br>        message -- explanation of the error<br>    """<br><br>    def __init__(self, salary, message="Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range"):<br>        self.salary = salary<br>        self.message = message<br>        super().__init__(self.message)<br><br>    def __str__(self):<br>        return f'{self.salary} -> {self.message}'<br><br><br>salary = int(input("Enter salary amount: "))<br>if not 5000 < salary < 15000:<br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>Output<br><br>Enter salary amount: 2000<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "/home/bsoyuj/Desktop/Untitled-1.py", line 20, in <module><br>    raise SalaryNotInRangeError(salary)<br>__main__.SalaryNotInRangeError: 2000 -> Salary is not in (5000, 15000) range<br>To learn more about how you can handle exceptions in Python, visit Python Exception Handling.<br><br>Previous Tutorial:<br>Exception Handling<br>Next Tutorial:<br>Python OOP<br>Share on:<br>Did you find this article helpful?<br>Related Tutorials<br>Python Tutorial<br><br>Python Exception Handling Using try, except and finally statement<br><br>Python Tutorial<br><br>Python Errors and Built-in Exceptions<br><br>Python Library<br><br>Python Dictionary get()<br><br>Python Library<br><br>Python List sort()<br><br><br>Get Python App<br><br><br>Join our newsletter for the latest updates.<br>Enter Email Address*<br>Join<br>Tutorials<br>Python 3 Tutorial<br>JavaScript Tutorial<br>C Tutorial<br>Java Tutorial<br>Kotlin Tutorial<br>C++ Tutorial<br>Swift Tutorial<br>C# Tutorial<br>DSA Tutorial<br>Examples<br>Python Examples<br>JavaScript Examples<br>C Examples<br>Java Examples<br>Kotlin Examples<br>C++ Examples<br>Company<br>About<br>Advertising<br>Privacy Policy<br>Terms & Conditions<br>Contact<br>Blog<br>Youtube<br>Apps<br>Learn Python<br>Learn C Programming<br>Learn Java<br><br><br><br>© Parewa Labs Pvt.

"We have recognised Kuwait's borders and statehood . . . so why not open a new page?" he said. "If Iraq is required to apologise for some incident for a new start, then that should be within a fair and collective apology and we are ready to apologise," Mr Aziz said. "We want Arabs to condemn the US strikes on Iraq and decide that sanctions should be lifted. We want Arabs to decide to eliminate the sanctions and not ask the UN to do so."<br><br>Iraq's parliament will resume a debate tomorrow on whether the country should continue to recognise Kuwait and the demarcation of borders between the two states, a senior MP said yesterday.<br><br>"The National Assembly will hold an extraordinary session to debate a number of issues, among them Iraq's recognition of Kuwait and borders between the two countries," said Mr Khalid alDouri, head of the parliament's Arab and Foreign Relations Committee.<br><br>Earlier this month, parliament shrugged off calls by some MPs to withdraw recognition of Kuwait, whose 1990 invasion by Iraq led to the 1991 Gulf War, and of the border demarcation. Instead, the assembly issued a mild statement in response to last month's US-led air strikes on Iraq.<br><br>Mr Douri said Iraq had met its commitments towards Kuwait but the emirate had not met its obligations toward Baghdad.<br><br>"Kuwait is continuing to commit aggression against Iraq. Therefore, why should we unilaterally stick to our commitments?" Mr Douri said.<br><br>Baghdad said Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had in effect taken part in last month's air strikes because they allowed Western aircraft to use their territory.<br><br>In 1994 the parliament voted to recognise Kuwait with its UN-defined borders, meeting one of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire terms which Baghdad had accepted after its forces were driven from Kuwait in February 1991.<br><br>Mr Douri said Iraq was promised that sanctions would be lifted if it recognised the emirate, but that had not happened yet.<br><br>Yesterday, a US F-15 fighter attacked an Iraqi missile installation in the northern no-fly zone, the second straight day of US action against Iraqi forces, the Pentagon said. A spokesman said the F-15 fired in self-defence after aircraft enforcing the no-fly zone were tracked by Iraqi radar from the ground. There was no damage to US planes in the incident, he said.<br><br>Yesterday's incident was the ninth clash in the Western-declared no-fly zones since Operation Desert Fox in December.

Is it just because we’re two people with two completely separate minds spending so much time together that we’re bound to not see eye to eye once in a while? Or, is it something more profound, something deeper?<br><br>Unfortunately, it’s usually the people we’re closest to who trigger us most emotionally. Our reactions, or overreactions, can therefore be much more tied to our personal history than even to what’s going on in the present moment. Every one of us brings a lot to the table that contributes to the degree of conflict we experience with a partner, including our early attachment patterns, psychological defenses, and critical inner voices about ourselves and others. That is why the key to getting along with our partner is rarely as simple as it sounds. However, the good news is we have a lot of power when it comes to making things better.<br><br>Here are some efforts we can take to ease tension and keep feeling close to our partner:<br><br>Don’t fester<br><br>A study from researchers at the University of California Berkeley and Northwestern University found that “the length of time each member of a couple spent being upset [when in conflict] was strongly correlated with their long-term marital happiness.” This is no great surprise. However, most of us don’t challenge our tendency to ruminate in feelings of being enraged, wronged, or treated unfairly. We may even be drawn to build a case against our partner rather than attempting to understand them, move on, or accept an apology. While we may have a point or be right at times, this drive to wallow in our misery often comes from an unconscious desire to maintain an old, bad feeling about ourselves and our relationships that, although uncomfortable, also feels familiar.<br><br>Take the time to calm down<br><br>In the heat of the moment, it’s very hard not to be reactive. However, there’s a good reason that five minutes after a fight, we feel more rational and regretful. When we feel triggered by someone in an intense way, this is often a clue that something deeper is being surfaced. The wrong word or a simple look from our partner can tap into old, negative feelings we have about ourselves that make us angry, ashamed, or on the defense. We then react in ways that don’t always fit the situation, and in fact, often escalate it. If we can get ahold of ourselves in that moment of intensity, take a walk or even just a few deep breaths, we can gain some perspective and return to a more rational state of mind. We can remain in the moment, rather than trailing off into our heads, and choose how we want to respond with more awareness and sensitivity to the other person.<br><br>Be attuned to yourself<br><br>In addition to taking pause, we can try to be curious about what’s going on in our minds and bodies in a moment of tension. There are two exercises that can be helpful in this process (which are made a bit easier to remember by the acronyms SIFT and RAIN). Dr. Daniel Siegel uses SIFTing to describe tuning into the Sensations, Images, Feelings, and Thoughts that we’re experiencing. This helps bring us into the moment, and it’s part of an important first step in what Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn calls RAIN. The steps of RAIN are to 1. Recognize what is happening, 2. Allow or accept what’s going on, 3. Investigate the inner experience (what’s being triggered in you?), and 4. Non-identification, which means not letting yourself over-connect with the experience. This mindful approach allows us to be present and curious toward ourselves and our reactions without letting these reactions take over. In a moment of conflict, we can use this mindfulness exercise to feel calmer and reconnect to ourselves, investigating our reactions but without judgment.<br><br>Change from a defensive to a receptive state<br><br>When we work on tuning in and calming ourselves down, we can then extend a more curious and compassionate attitude toward our partner. Instead of being focused on defending, reacting, or counterattacking, we can listen and attempt to understand the other person.  “When our entire focus is on self-defense, no matter what we do, we can’t open ourselves enough to hear our partner’s words accurately,” wrote Siegel in Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation. “Our state of mind can turn even neutral comments into fighting words, distorting what we hear to fit what we fear.”  The more we can remain in a “receptive state,” being present with our partner and imagining their experience through their eyes, the more we can relax in ourselves and connect to them. We can actually use the experience to feel closer rather than pushing them further away. As Siegel wrote in The Developing Mind: How Relationships and the Brain Interact to Shape Who We Are, “For ‘full’ emotional communication, one person needs to allow his state of mind to be influenced by that of the other.”<br><br>Reject the filter of your critical inner voice<br><br>Part of the reason we’re so reactive in a given moment is because we often hear or see our partner through the filter of our “critical inner voice.” This “voice” represents a pattern of negative thoughts and distorted ideas we developed about ourselves and others based on hurtful experiences from our early lives. As we grow up, we may expect relationships to mirror those of our past and project our “voices” onto others, especially those closest to us. “All misperceptions or projections, both positive and negative, will generate problems,” wrote Dr. Robert Firestone in The Ethics of Interpersonal Relationships. “People want to be seen and acknowledged for themselves, and distortions cause pain and misunderstanding as well as predisposing angry reactions.” So often, when we’re especially triggered and heated, we are filtering our partner’s words and behavior through our inner critic. For example, when they say, “You haven’t been around lately,” we may hear, “You’re not doing enough. You’re so lazy.” We distort our partner’s point of view to fit with an old image of ourselves, and we react accordingly. That is why to really break a destructive, argumentative cycle, we have to challenge our critical inner voice.<br><br>Drop your half of the dynamic<br><br>Dr. Lisa Firestone, co-author of Sex and Love in Intimate Relationships recommends what she calls “unilateral disarmament” as a tool couples can use to defuse arguments and be close again. “What it involves is momentarily dropping your side of the debate and approaching your partner from a more loving stance,” explained Firestone. “The idea is that when couples have tension between them, perhaps from not communicating successfully or directly, they start to build resentments toward each other, which often reach a tipping point. An argument begins, then escalates based on an overflow of pent-up frustration and flawed communication. Heated moments are, however, the worst times to try to solve problems or make our points heard.” By dropping our half of the dynamic and saying “I care more about being close than winning this argument,” we express a vulnerability that often softens our partner and allows them to feel for us and let their guard down. We can then have a more effective conversation about any real issues in a less intense moment when we both feel more ourselves.<br><br>Feel the feeling, but do the right thing<br><br>Calming down or dropping our side of a fight in a tense moment doesn’t mean burying our feelings. In fact, Dr. Pat Love author of The Truth about Love suggests we feel our feelings but choose our actions. There are healthy avenues for expressing anger or sadness but also exploring these emotions to understand where they may come from and what they may mean. Emotions offer us clues into who we are. However, in the messiness of a fight, we rarely take the time to sort through and recognize our emotions much less express them in ways that are adaptive or helpful. It’s best to choose our actions, so they align with who we want to be. But we should certainly be curious and accepting of our emotions.<br><br>Be vulnerable and express what you want<br><br>Les Greenberg, the primary originator of Emotion-Focused Therapy, distinguishes between primary and secondary, adaptive and maladaptive emotion. He points out that often, when couples react to each other, they aren’t necessarily aware of the primary emotion like sadness or shame that maybe triggered, for instance, in a moment of feeling hurt, rejected or not seen. Instead, they experience a secondary emotion like embarrassment or anger, and they act out toward their partner accordingly.<br><br>We all experience these types of reactions, and unfortunately, these maladaptive emotional responses don’t get us closer to what we want. However, as Greenberg has suggested, if we can tap into our primary emotion and express the more vulnerable want or need behind it, we show much more vulnerability to our partner. We can communicate that “we want to feel loved or seen for who we are.” Our partner then has an opportunity to know us better and feel for us.<br><br>As challenging as it can feel to be vulnerable and let our guard down in a moment of conflict, the more mindful we can be toward ourselves, our emotions, our thoughts, and our actions, the better able we are to interrupt destructive cycles and achieve closeness with our partner. By using these tools of self-reflection, we truly take control over our half of the dynamic and create a safe, welcoming environment for our partner to do the same.<br><br>Here are some takeaways that we can apply the next time we enter a conflict with our partner:<br>Take pause (do something else, breathe, meditate, take a walk)<br>Avoid rumination<br>Pay attention to what’s going on inside your body<br>Don’t over-identify with negative thoughts<br>Try to adopt a “receptive” stance<br>Notice any critical inner voices intensifying your response<br>Acknowledge your emotions<br>Explore whether the emotion may be primary, secondary, adaptive, or maladaptive<br>Choose your actions<br>Be open, vulnerable, and direct about what you want<br><br><br>Handling Conflict in Relationships<br>Length: 90 Minutes<br>Price: $15<br>On-Demand Webinars<br>In this Webinar:  Many couples are facing new strains on their relationship that are making life at home all the more difficult.

In my opinion, it’s completely normal to argue with your spouse, what matters is how do you make up after an argument. I too have fights with my boyfriend, in the early phase of our relationship we never used to fight but now we fight over silly things. I feel that I am more argumentative but cannot do anything about it haha…, one of my friends suggested me to go to Alex Barnette, she is an expert counselor. I hope she would help me with this problem.<br><br>Reply<br> Eureka August 17th, 2019<br>My boyfriend and i are too different,i like relaxing outside by the balcony,he likes relaxing inside the house,we fight over the fact that I can’t join him inside all the time,what can we do to make it work?<br><br>Reply<br> AnitaTaco October 2nd, 2019<br>Maybe you are both focusing on the wrong aspects! Inside, outside, the only important part is that it’s you and him together, no matter where you might be. If the weather is nice where you live or you have especially beautiful sunsets, have him join you sometime where he might gain a new appreciation for the balcon or something like that. On the other hand, if it gets hot mid afternoon (I live in Arizona, it’s like 113 in the summer) or cold in the morning, join him inside & enjoy being warm/or not in the hot sun. Even tell him, “You know what? Inside, outside, it doesn’t matter as long as I have you! We could in the 7th circle of Hell (also known as the Dept of Motor Vehicle =D lol) & I would be fine because I have you by my side!”<br>My husband and I are very opposite, but it would be so boring to be married to myself! I can barely even stand me sometimes! LOl…good thing he feels the opposite! It can work, we are living proof. We’ve been together 14 years and married almost 12. Only in the last 2 years have we had any internal turmoil, the 1st 12 years, we fought maybe 10% of the amount most normal couples do. (Normal? What’s that? Lol)<br><br>Anyone that says love is effortless or a feeling has never been in love! It takes hard work, effort & love is most definitely a verb, it’s something we have to actively choose to do with intention for the one we love, not for ourself. We get the benefits of loving them, but it’s gotta be selfless and for the benefit of the one you’re loving!<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Reply<br> Masha October 5th, 2019<br>What to do if I have tried all these steps but yet end up in the same, loveless marriage situation? I love him a lot, but I love me, too. I want to be happy and I want him to happy. I hate fighting. I don’t want to fight. He is a beautiful person, inside out. I guess we are not meant to be together.<br><br>Reply<br> Todd November 15th, 2019<br>I agree. Collaboration and together in healing and growing.

I have hard time active listening and suffer from anxiety that gets worse when I stress or feel something is not right between us. He has made some mistakes in the past that were heartbreaking. I forgave him and then we later got engaged. Tonight we got into an argument and he broke up with me and left the house. it’s almost 4 am and I don’t know or understand his actions. Is there someone else, or other distractions again or what can be the reason. It is not normal if one wants to be alone. Or is this not ok for man or woman engaged? He ment it to be break up?Knowing what kind of memories it brings back for me. I don’t know how to take all of this. I love him dearly and was going to get professional help for my anxiety and personal issues but he said he can’t wait anymore and wants to be single. I am so confused… ((( i am devastated . plz someone help how to talk to him ? I love him with all my heart and believe he is the one. I come from a different culture on top of that and we have 8 yr difference. Which I love. I dunno what to do with myself. I know we can be so happy with him.

He’s a nice guy and tolerates me all the time but this time I think he is fed up. Because when ever we fight I will get angry and ask for a brakup.. He would say no but it hasn’t got to that. Then everything goes back to normal.. But this time around we had a fight I insulted him and asked for a brakeup and he agreed but this time around I don’t want to loose him I really love him and not ready to let him go. Now we are back after 3days but he has really changed towards me he hardly talks to me in a nice way he’s always angry even tho he says he loves me..<br>Am confused I don’t know what to do about his new attitude towards me it hurts me and brakes me down please help me am so hurt and confused now please help me and how to get us happy<br><br>Reply<br> Cathy July 11th, 2020<br>It’s abusive to threaten a breakup every time you fight- a form of abusive manipulation to keep you in power. It works but the problem is it damages the other person each time and makes the relationship totally unstable. Also insulting him doesn’t help. After being hurt so much of course he is going to start to hate you.<br><br>You need to apologize for ever telling him you would leave, and for insulting him. Tell him you were wrong to do it, love him and promise you will never do it again and will never leave him, no matter what. Tell him that every time you want to insult him instead you will compliment him. It will be hard for you to stop this abusive pattern but STOP.<br><br>See what happens.<br><br>Good luck!!<br><br>Reply<br> Ana March 23rd, 2021<br>I am in the same situation. I threatened him many times with break up and even blocked him because he kept hrut hurting me. I hate being lied and he did it a couple of time into my face. He knew how much I hate dishonesty and how much I appreciate communication and openness in the relationship. After many fights, we broke up and he insisted everything was my fault, even the fact that he lied. This showed me he lacks awareness of hia actions and avoids responsibility. I threatened him many times with the break up but he insisted on getting back, I now regretted I did not sticked to my idea. From. Begging I knew something did not feel right, I felt unease in the realtionship and always wondering about honesty which took my energy and happiness. I hope I will fully recover. Keep your heap up, your are better off single than with selfish, immature men.<br><br>Reply<br> Rebecca July 3rd, 2021<br>I completely agree with Cathy. It is abusive (though I’m sure unintentional) to threaten a breakup every time you fight. I know this, because I used to do it too. Whenever my husband and I would have a bad fight, I would say things like, “Maybe we’ll just be happier if we end it” or “I want out.” Truthfully, sometimes in the heat of the moment I thought I meant it, but never felt the same way when I woke up the next morning. Over time, I have realized that saying those things weakens the relationship a little more each time.<br><br>One of my favorite things about my husband is the stability he makes me feel. He lets me know he’s in it for the long haul, no matter what. By saying the things I did during the more heated fights, I was denying him that same security. I truly love him with all my heart and that’s not what I want to do the man I love, no matter how mad I was at him. Fortunately, I realized this early enough in our relationship that I was able to stop this. It was hard, because we are both very passionate and emotional people, but I stopped because I love him and want him to feel the same security in our marriage that he makes me feel. When you chose someone for life, you have a strong and very direct ability to influence their happiness in life. Why wouldn’t you want the one you love to feel happy, and secure, and loved?<br><br>I feel that in the 7 years we have been married, we have both matured a lot, which really helps. We still have our fights, because.. well we are very different people with different thoughts and points of view on many things, but the fallout is much better. We communicate better and I feel our relationship is much stronger. We know how much we love each other and that makes it all worth it.<br><br>All of what I just said applies if this is the man you love and want to marry. If he is untrustworthy, and not willing to put in any effort, or if you truly want to break up, then maybe take these lessons to better yourself for your next relationship.<br><br>I hope whatever you do brings you happiness.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Reply<br> Bazzy September 10th, 2020<br>What does it means when someone in relationship is feed up<br><br>Reply<br> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQd8pE_K9OH3gCHTnlH6qHw/videos November 1st, 2020<br>It’s so tricky when there are arguments in a relationship and one person shuts down. It’s very painful the the other person whom is trying to communicate. It’s a difficult task after time as past to break the ice when both parties refuse to give in.<br><br>Reply<br> thalia November 6th, 2020<br>I need help. ive been with my boyfriend for 3 1/2 years he proposed to me about 4 months ago. we lived together for 2 years. he moved away for work 6 months ago to a different state and he left with one day notice and it completely freaked me out and changed me in the relationship. i felt like he abandoned me when he left and i lost trust and i think respect. ive been now living with him in the new state for a month now which stresses me out because i am 2,000 miles away from everything i ever knew. ive never moved at all in my life and i’ve always been with my parents. im about to turn 21. I pick fights with him almost every day and i get mad so easily at little things i shouldn’t care about and i make the fights last for litterly hours on end and it is emotionally draining for the both of us but he doesn’t even try to communicate with me which angers me more because he just shuts down 5-10 mins into the conversation and i spend hours begging him to talk to me it seems but i get kind of mean because of how mad i am at the whole thing. I feel like i’m crazy now and idk why i changed like this. we now have a cycle of fighting and it seems like it will never break. how do i change myself? how do i become a good person? i want to be a nice person to him because he’s so nice most of the time just when i make him mad he gets mad too sometimes but i can’t blame him. how do i control myself and not be mean to him and start fights. i love him and care about him so much but he said to me tonight that he doesn’t think i do anymore and it hurts so much. i feel like i’ve been in so much pain for so long that i almost can’t feel anything anymore. i want to feel better for myself too.<br><br>Reply<br> Matthew June 26th, 2021<br>Why does my future wife, always pack her bag and leave to her home. No matter what the fight is about. She always does that. I don’t know if she will be back this time or not. Now I want to end it. She says she is not coming back. So what do I do?<br><br>Reply<br> Nicole Dodge July 14th, 2021<br>I have been with my boyfriend for 8 years and we have 1 child and another one on the way. We fight all the time but instead of trying to resolve anything he walks away from me and goes and runs to his mommy saying how mean I am or that I’m trying to hold him back or make him change. Here’s the real cool thing, we live with his 75 year old, widowed since 2005, narcissistic mother. He makes me out to be the bad guy when I’m exhausted after working for 9 hours, while I’m 6 months pregnant, and I get upset because after work I make dinner, clean up the kitchen, do the dishes, and then bathe and dress our daughter and he says I’m going next door to drink with the neighbor and doesn’t come home til 11 at night knowing i have to be up at 5am. He refuses to apologize for his behavior and he doesn’t even show he cares instead he says that I’m a hindrance to him and that I am trying to control and manipulate him. He then will normally go on about what a crappy individual I am and how I should just get out of his house. He continues this for probably about 30 minutes and I finally put in my ear buds while I’m crying feeling as though I’ve done something wrong and that I deserve this. He will then pass out and when he gets up in the morning , it’s like it never happened to him because he was so drunk he doesn’t remember it. When he realizes that I’m upset with him, he starts saying I caused the fight or he says well if you wouldn’t do or say this and just let me do what I want we would not fight. Basically that it’s all my fault for me being upset and for the way he talks to me and how he treats me. If I try and defend myself or if I raise my voice a little bit, mommy comes running in to back him up and help him make me feel unwanted, worthless, and like I’m below them and dont deserve to have a voice. I dont know what else I can do. I’ve asked for counseling for us but he says i wont allow us to be happy or stable so it’s not gonna help. I love him but after 8 years i think it might be time for me to let go. Can someone please offer something, anything that i can do to get through to him or should Isay I’ve had enough and leave to get myself healthy mentally for me and my children?<br><br>Reply<br> Jess August 11th, 2021<br>I definitely think you should trust your gut on this. If he’s making you feel that way while you’re doing so much for him, (and your kids) and trying to hard to fix your relationship, then he doesn’t want to fix it. Some people find comfort in anger or blame. And knowing when you need to cut those people off, not only for yourself but for your kids, gives you such a feeling of relief. It may hurt right now, believe me. But it’ll be so much better for you guys in the long run. I really hope this helps you, even just a little <3<br><br>Reply<br> Mercy August 31st, 2021<br>I’m in a long distance relationship.He is 44 and I’m 25. The relationship is about three months old. Sometimes we really argue hard.I try not to shout at him because I told him that I don’t want either.We argued yesterday and he told me that we shall talk when I’m more calm.I sent him a message yesterday with no response.I tried calling him this afternoon, he didn’t pick my call. He simply replied my message and said,” I’m busy today at work , we talk when I finish the job.”I feel so frustrated. I’m so empty without him but I really don’t want to show him that I can take any shit from him bearing in mind that he is on the wrong.I really don’t want these conflicts but I don’t know how to avoid them. Should I just allow any mistake I notice slide for the sake of peace?<br>I’m one low spirited girl at the moment😔.<br><br>Reply<br> Refiloe March 12th, 2022<br>I’m 25yrs old been in a 5yr relationship dating a 28yrs old boyfriend who is planning to get married to me and we’re pregnant but we fight a lot, I end up crying stressing out and always feel like I should just leave him now a lot of things has changed he doesn’t do much of what he used to do in our relationship, I feel bad because he’s got two children aside our relationship I actually expect him to treat me like he treated his ex when they were pregnant or is he treating me like this because it’s not his first?

This is because the <strong> a semantic element whereas <b> is not. Non-semantic elements can make content localization and future proofing difficult, according to the HTML5 specification.

As frustrating as this may be, the good news is that you're not alone. According to the American Medical Association, more than 75% of women experience some emotional distress between the onset of menstruation and the culmination of menopause.<br>Symptoms of mood swings include irritability, depression, fatigue and insomnia. Mood swings are caused by a hormonal imbalance and the effect the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone have on serotonin levels in the brain. They disrupt the ability to think clearly, process information and react well to stress. Treatment has traditionally been focused on reducing the roller coaster-type symptoms with narcotic drugs such as lithium and valium. But new understanding about the cause of mood swings has led to more natural therapies centered on botanical enhancements, diet and exercise.<br>The New Herbs<br>Serotonin is the brain chemical responsible for modulating mood. If serotonin levels are high, so are our moods. If levels are low, mood drops.<br><br>Mood swings occur when serotonin levels rise and fall rapidly, leading to the roller coaster ride of emotion many women experience during their menstruation and menopause cycles. Both estrogen and progesterone, which fluctuate during a woman’s cycle, control serotonin production levels. While in the past physicians have treated mood swings with artificial forms of estrogen and progesterone like those found in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy, natural forms of these important hormones can be found in several herbs and plants that are readily available.<br>Natural progesterone can be found in Mexican wild yam (diascorea villosa), a common root that contains a substance that when metabolized converts to progesterone. The substance is best absorbed through the skin, making it a perfect enhancement to skin creams and lotions. Available at most natural health stores, look for products containing “natural progesterone.”<br>Estrogen is even more abundant in the botanical world since many plants contain phytoestrogens, which affect the body in the same way as natural estrogen. You may have heard that soy products were good for PMS and menopause and the reason is that soybeans contain some of the highest levels of phytoestrogens found, making them especially potent in the fight against mood swings. Tofu, both cooked and raw, is an abundant source of phytoestrogen, as are fresh soybeans, known as Edamame. A common staple in the Asian diet, fresh soybeans can be found in markets specializing in Asian foods and most health food stores. You may even be able to find frozen soybeans in grocery stores.<br>MOST HELPFUL<br>Looking for Happiness at Your Local Park?

These natural mood swing treatments are also found in red clover (Trifolium pretense), alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra). Legumes like peas, beans, lentils and peanuts contain phytoestrogens as well and can reduce mood swing symptoms significantly.<br>Vitamins and Minerals<br>Never has the admonition to take your vitamins been as important as when feeling the effects of mood swings. In the delicate dance of hormones and cell function that plays out every second during the course of life, vitamins and minerals play an important role. Cells depend on vitamins and minerals to create certain chemical reactions necessary to produce vital hormones and other chemicals, such as serotonin. Magnesium, zinc, and iron are crucial in the treatment of mood swings because they help the muscles relax, reducing cramping and pain that lower serotonin levels. Vitamins B5, B6, B12, and C also affect the nervous system by reducing stress, another key element in mood swings. Taking the daily recommended dose of a complex multi-vitamin with minerals, as well as additional B-complex supplements can eliminate mood swings in many sufferers and dramatically reduce the occurrence of severe mood swings in others.<br>The Right Foods<br>The kind of foods you are eating may be causing your mood swings, which in turn can cause you to overeat. A diet rich in complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and the legumes mentioned earlier, peas, beans, peanuts and lentils help eliminate mood swings by raising serotonin.<br>In addition, legumes are an excellent source of phytoestrogens, which can help maintain an acceptable hormonal balance in women. This can be especially helpful when women experience natural fluctuations during menopause or at the beginning of their monthly periods.<br>Foods that aid liver function are also effective treatments for mood swings. The liver helps balance estrogen levels and in doing so, helps minimize mood swing symptoms.  Vegetables like broccoli, carrots, spinach, pumpkin, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower boost liver function and can help ward off mood swings. Tomatoes, whether cooked or raw, are also another great choice. Sweet potatoes are extremely rich in liver-friendly enzymes and when topped with a little low-calorie spread they are better than just about anything for a quick pick-up that is healthy and long-lasting. It is important to stay away from toxic foods such as refined carbohydrates, high sugar desserts, alcohol, caffeine and anything with trans-fat when suffering from mood swings because these foods stress the liver and can increase your symptoms.<br>Getting Physical<br>Physical activity is also effective at reducing the symptoms of mood swings by helping to lower blood pressure and improving the body’s ability to handle stress. Regular exercise also improves bone density and muscle strength, improving overall health. Sometimes the last thing you feel like doing when your hormones are raging is get up and take a walk, however that might be just the thing you need to manage your emotions and bring your mood swings under control. Practicing relaxing techniques such as yoga, meditation or massage therapy can also be effective.<br>Yoga breathing exercises lower blood pressure. Meditation exercises can leave your mind clearer and better equipped to respond to changing brain chemistry. A good massage is always welcome, especially when you may be feeling stressed.  While the connection between relaxation and hormone levels is not proven, maintaining a calm perspective or having calming strategies in your arsenal does give your body additional tools to handle mood swings when they do arise.<br>Pieces of the Puzzle<br><br>Just as no two women are alike, no two treatments for mood swings should be alike. Likewise, relying on standard drug therapies without examining the underlying causes of an individual’s mood swings is more likely to fail than a focused effort addressing diet, exercise and hormonal balance. If you suffer from mood swings or simply find your emotions running up and down like the turn of the tide, first consider your overall hormonal balance based on the cycle of your life. If you need more estrogen, consider phytoestrogens found in plants and herbs. If you need to boost serotonin, make regular vitamins and minerals a part of your daily routine and watch what you eat. Lastly, take time for yourself on a regular basis, making your mood swings a thing of the past.<br><br>Mental Wellness<br>NEWSLETTERS<br>Sign up for our Mental Wellness Newsletter!<br>Enter your email<br>Enter your email<br>Subscribe<br>By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.<br><br>THE LATEST IN EMOTIONAL HEALTH<br>Depp v.

Now that the youngest Millennials are adults, how do they compare with those who were their age in the generations that came before them?<br><br>In general, they’re better educated – a factor tied to employment and financial well-being – but there is a sharp divide between the economic fortunes of those who have a college education and those who don’t.<br><br>Millennials have brought more racial and ethnic diversity to American society. And Millennial women, like Generation X women, are more likely to participate in the nation’s workforce than prior generations.<br><br>Compared with previous generations, Millennials – those ages 22 to 37 in 2018 – are delaying or foregoing marriage and have been somewhat slower in forming their own households. They are also more likely to be living at home with their parents, and for longer stretches.<br><br>And Millennials are now the second-largest generation in the U.S. electorate (after Baby Boomers), a fact that continues to shape the country’s politics given their Democratic leanings when compared with older generations.<br><br>Those are some of the broad strokes that have emerged from Pew Research Center’s work on Millennials over the past few years. Now that the youngest Millennials are in their 20s, we have done a comprehensive update of our prior demographic work on generations. Here are the details.<br><br>Education<br>Today’s young adults are much better educated than their grandparents, as the share of young adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher has steadily climbed since 1968. Among Millennials, around four-in-ten (39%) of those ages 25 to 37 have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared with just 15% of the Silent Generation, roughly a quarter of Baby Boomers and about three-in-ten Gen Xers (29%) when they were the same age.<br><br>Millennials are better educated than prior generations<br>Gains in educational attainment have been especially steep for young women. Among women of the Silent Generation, only 11% had obtained at least a bachelor’s degree when they were young (ages 25 to 37 in 1968). Millennial women are about four times (43%) as likely as their Silent predecessors to have completed as much education at the same age. Millennial men are also better educated than their predecessors. About one-third of Millennial men (36%) have at least a bachelor’s degree, nearly double the share of Silent Generation men (19%) when they were ages 25 to 37.<br><br>Among Millennials, women outpacing men in college completion<br>While educational attainment has steadily increased for men and women over the past five decades, the share of Millennial women with a bachelor’s degree is now higher than that of men – a reversal from the Silent Generation and Boomers. Gen X women were the first to outpace men in terms of education, with a 3-percentage-point advantage over Gen X men in 2001. Before that, late Boomer men in 1989 had a 2-point advantage over Boomer women.<br><br><br>Employment<br>From Boomers on, most young adult women have worked <br>Boomer women surged into the workforce as young adults, setting the stage for more Gen X and Millennial women to follow suit. In 1966, when Silent Generation women were ages 22 through 37, a majority (58%) were not participating in the labor force while 40% were employed. For Millennial women today, 72% are employed while just a quarter are not in the labor force. Boomer women were the turning point. As early as 1985, more young Boomer women were employed (66%) than were not in the labor force (28%).<br><br>Earnings of young adults have only increased for the college-educated<br>And despite a reputation for job hopping, Millennial workers are just as likely to stick with their employers as Gen X workers were when they were the same age. Roughly seven-in-ten each of Millennials ages 22 to 37 in 2018 (70%) and Gen Xers the same age in 2002 (69%) reported working for their current employer at least 13 months. About three-in-ten of both groups said they’d been with their employer for at least five years.<br><br>Of course, the economy varied for each generation. While the Great Recession affected Americans broadly, it created a particularly challenging job market for Millennials entering the workforce. The unemployment rate was especially high for America’s youngest adults in the years just after the recession, a reality that would impact Millennials’ future earnings and wealth.<br><br>Income and wealth<br>The financial well-being of Millennials is complicated. The individual earnings for young workers have remained mostly flat over the past 50 years. But this belies a notably large gap in earnings between Millennials who have a college education and those who don’t. Similarly, the household income trends for young adults markedly diverge by education. As far as household wealth, Millennials appear to have accumulated slightly less than older generations had at the same age.<br><br>Millennials with a bachelor’s degree or more and a full-time job had median annual earnings valued at $56,000 in 2018, roughly equal to those of college-educated Generation X workers in 2001. But for Millennials with some college or less, annual earnings were lower than their counterparts in prior generations. For example, Millennial workers with some college education reported making $36,000, lower than the $38,900 early Baby Boomer workers made at the same age in 1982. The pattern is similar for those young adults who never attended college.<br><br>Millennials in 2018 had a median household income of roughly $71,400, similar to that of Gen X young adults ($70,700) in 2001. (This analysis is in 2017 dollars and is adjusted for household size. Additionally, household income includes the earnings of the young adult, as well as the income of anyone else living in the household.)<br><br>For Millennials and Gen Xers, large education gaps in typical household income <br>The growing gap by education is even more apparent when looking at annual household income. For households headed by Millennials ages 25 to 37 in 2018, the median adjusted household income was about $105,300 for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, roughly $56,000 greater than that of households headed by high school graduates. The median household income difference by education for prior generations ranged from $41,200 for late Boomers to $19,700 for the Silent Generation when they were young.<br><br>While young adults in general do not have much accumulated wealth, Millennials have slightly less wealth than Boomers did at the same age. The median net worth of households headed by Millennials (ages 20 to 35 in 2016) was about $12,500 in 2016, compared with $20,700 for households headed by Boomers the same age in 1983. Median net worth of Gen X households at the same age was about $15,100.<br><br>This modest difference in wealth can be partly attributed to differences in debt by generation. Compared with earlier generations, more Millennials have outstanding student debt, and the amount of it they owe tends to be greater. The share of young adult households with any student debt doubled from 1998 (when Gen Xers were ages 20 to 35) to 2016 (when Millennials were that age). In addition, the median amount of debt was nearly 50% greater for Millennials with outstanding student debt ($19,000) than for Gen X debt holders when they were young ($12,800).<br><br>Housing<br>Millennials without a bachelor’s degree more likely to still be living with parents<br>Millennials, hit hard by the Great Recession, have been somewhat slower in forming their own households than previous generations. They’re more likely to live in their parents’ home and also more likely to be at home for longer stretches. In 2018, 15% of Millennials (ages 25 to 37) were living in their parents’ home. This is nearly double the share of early Boomers and Silents (8% each) and 6 percentage points higher than Gen Xers who did so when they were the same age.<br><br>The rise in young adults living at home is especially prominent among those with lower education. Millennials who never attended college were twice as likely as those with a bachelor’s degree or more to live with their parents (20% vs. 10%). This gap was narrower or nonexistent in previous generations. Roughly equal shares of Silents (about 7% each) lived in their parents’ home when they were ages 25 to 37, regardless of educational attainment.<br><br>Millennials are also moving significantly less than earlier generations of young adults. About one-in-six Millennials ages 25 to 37 (16%) have moved in the past year. For previous generations at the same age, roughly a quarter had.<br><br><br>Family<br>Millennials less likely to be married than previous generations at same age<br>On the whole, Millennials are starting families later than their counterparts in prior generations. Just under half (46%) of Millennials ages 25 to 37 are married, a steep drop from the 83% of Silents who were married in 1968. The share of 25- to 37-year-olds who were married steadily dropped for each succeeding generation, from 67% of early Boomers to 57% of Gen Xers. This in part reflects broader societal shifts toward marrying later in life. In 1968, the typical American woman first married at age 21 and the typical American man first wed at 23. Today, those figures have climbed to 28 for women and 30 for men.<br><br>But it’s not all about delayed marriage. The share of adults who have never married is increasing with each successive generation. If current patterns continue, an estimated one-in-four of today’s young adults will have never married by the time they reach their mid-40s to early 50s – a record high share.<br><br>Marriage rate has fallen the most among those with less education<br>In prior generations, those ages 25 to 37 whose highest level of education was a high school diploma were more likely than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher to be married. Gen Xers reversed this trend, and the divide widened among Millennials. Four-in-ten Millennials with just a high school diploma (40%) are currently married, compared with 53% of Millennials with at least a bachelor’s degree. In comparison, 86% of Silent Generation high school graduates were married in 1968 versus 81% of Silents with a bachelor’s degree or more.<br><br>Millennial women are also waiting longer to become parents than prior generations did. In 2016, 48% of Millennial women (ages 20 to 35 at the time) were moms. When Generation X women were the same age in 2000, 57% were already mothers, similar to the share of Boomer women (58%) in 1984. Still, Millennial women now account for the vast majority of annual U.S. births, and more than 17 million Millennial women have become mothers.<br><br>Voting<br>Younger generations (Generation X, Millennials and Generation Z) now make up a clear majority of America’s voting-eligible population. As of November 2018, nearly six-in-ten adults eligible to vote (59%) were from one of these three generations, with Boomers and older generations making up the other 41%.<br><br>Gen Xers and younger generations are the clear majority of eligible voters<br>However, young adults have historically been less likely to vote than their older counterparts, and these younger generations have followed that same pattern, turning out to vote at lower rates than older generations in recent elections.<br><br>In the 2016 election, Millennials and Gen Xers cast more votes than Boomers and older generations, giving the younger generations a slight majority of total votes cast. However, higher shares of Silent/Greatest generation eligible voters (70%) and Boomers (69%) reported voting in the 2016 election compared with Gen X (63%) and Millennial (51%) eligible voters. Going forward, Millennial turnout may increase as this generation grows older.<br><br>Generational differences in political attitudes and partisan affiliation are as wide as they have been in decades. Among registered voters, 59% of Millennials affiliate with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic, compared with about half of Boomers and Gen Xers (48% each) and 43% of the Silent Generation. With this divide comes generational differences on specific issue areas, from views of racial discrimination and immigration to foreign policy and the scope of government.<br><br>Population change and the future<br>By 2019, Millennials are projected to number 73 million, overtaking Baby Boomers as the largest living adult generation. Although a greater number of births underlie the Baby Boom generation, Millennials will outnumber Boomers in part because immigration has been boosting their numbers.<br><br>Projected population by generation<br>Millennials are also bringing more racial and ethnic diversity. When the Silent Generation was young (ages 22 to 37), 84% were non-Hispanic white. For Millennials, the share is just 55%. This change is driven partly by the growing number of Hispanic and Asian immigrants, whose ranks have increased since the Boomer generation. The increased prevalence of interracial marriage and differences in fertility patterns have also contributed to the country’s shifting racial and ethnic makeup.<br><br>Looking ahead at the next generation, early benchmarks show Generation Z (those ages 6 to 21 in 2018) is on track to be the nation’s most diverse and best-educated generation yet. Nearly half (48%) are racial or ethnic minorities. And while most are still in K-12 schools, the oldest Gen Zers are enrolling in college at a higher rate than even Millennials were at their age. Early indications are that their opinions on issues are similar to those of Millennials.<br><br>Of course, Gen Z is still very young and may be shaped by future unknown events. But Pew Research Center looks forward to spending the next few years studying life for this new generation as it enters adulthood.<br><br>All photos via Getty Images<br><br><br>Sign up for our weekly newsletter<br>Fresh data delivered Saturday mornings<br><br>Email address<br>Pew Research Center<br>1615 L St. NW, Suite 800<br>Washington, DC 20036<br>USA<br>(+1) 202-419-4300 | Main<br>(+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax<br>(+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries<br><br>RESEARCH TOPICS<br>Politics & Policy<br>International Affairs<br>Immigration & Migration<br>Race & Ethnicity<br>Religion<br>Generations & Age<br>Gender & LGBTQ<br>Family & Relationships<br>Economy & Work<br>Science<br>Internet & Technology<br>News Habits & Media<br>Methodological Research<br>Full topic list<br>FOLLOW US<br> Email Newsletters<br> Facebook<br> Twitter<br> Tumblr<br> YouTube<br> RSS<br>ABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

The price of pushing kids to attain elite status.<br><br><br>by Ragini Tharoor Srinivasan<br>August 28, 2018<br><br><br>I am an English professor. That means that after thirteen years of elementary and high school, four years of university, and seven more years of graduate education, I decided that I hadn’t yet had enough of school.<br><br>Over the years, my position at the table has changed—now I’m the one apologizing for bad penmanship on the blackboard. But I am literally still in school, because I believe deeply in the processes and aspirations of education.<br><br>I value school. So people think I’m joking when I tell them the following: That it truly doesn’t matter where they go to college. And that my daughter can be anything she wants to be—except a straight-A student.<br><br>I’ve been affiliated with major public and private universities in California, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, and now Nevada. I’ve worked with world famous public intellectuals and lesser known scholars of equal intellect. I’ve taught graduates of America’s elite high schools, first generation college-bound students, and “non-traditional” students.<br><br>I know, and don’t deny, the value of a “name-brand” college, but a “name-brand” college is no guarantee of an inspiring education, never mind lifelong success. I know that you can find committed, brilliant teachers and students in any institution—and that numerous factors determine who ends up where. And I know what it means to be a straight-A student, and what it doesn’t. I know what good grades, high SAT scores, AP exams, and admission to highly-ranked colleges get you, and what they don’t, and how, finally, irrelevant all of that is to the work of trying to live and build, for oneself and others, a meaningful, critical life.<br><br>Let me say that again, with a different emphasis. Most people agree that high SAT scores don’t equate to a meaningful life, and that GPAs don’t capture intellectual potential. But what if—when taken to the extreme—a belief in quantified academic merit is actually at odds with the pursuit of academic and personal excellence?<br><br>All over the country, educators, parents, and pundits are now asking variants of this question. Open a newspaper anywhere in the country, and you’ll read about “high-pressure” schools and the health risks associated with increased stress among those who are overly focused on grades, resume-padding, and what Frank Bruni calls, in Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be, “the college admissions mania.”<br><br>“Expectations surrounding education have spun out of control,” argues Vicki Abeles, author of Beyond Measure. “On top of a seven-hour school day, our kids march through hours of nightly homework, daily sports practices and band rehearsals, and weekend-consuming assignments and tournaments. Each activity is seen as a step on the ladder to a top college, an enviable job and a successful life.”<br><br>Did you like this story?<br>Would you like to receive articles like this in your inbox? Free!<br>Enter your email<br><br>SUBSCRIBE<br>India Currents has long been attuned to this problem, given that our first circle of address includes high-achieving Indian Americans of the competitive Silicon Valley. “Let Kids Be Kids,” Nirupama Vaidhyanathan wrote in these pages nearly a decade ago, recounting the machinations of “overzealous Indian parents” who micromanage (if not complete) their children’s homework and jealously watch the successes of their peers. In 2013, Sarita Sarvate argued in Letting Children Be Children that the Indian American community in the Valley is too “obsessed with success” and filled with “Tiger moms” and dads who make comparatively less ambitious Indians “feel like pariahs.”<br><br>To be clear: This is not an indictment of achievement. You or your children might be among the Bay Area’s many Speech-and-Debaters, Spelling Bee-ers, and Intel Science Searchers. I, too, grew up in San Jose and am the product of schools known for academic rigor. But when researchers like Abeles are reporting a “nationwide epidemic of school-related stress,” it bears asking: what exactly are we emphasizing when we emphasize grades and college admissions? As a community that values “achievement,” what have we achieved?<br><br>I was beginning a graduate program in the East Bay when, in 2009-2010, Palo Alto experienced its first “suicide cluster”: six teenagers, including four from the same school, killed themselves over a span of nine months. The news was incredibly disturbing, but I soon put it out of my mind as a grotesque aberration. Part of me clearly didn’t want to believe that high schoolers now experience stresses meriting suicide-prevention and wide-scale communal intervention.<br><br>When the “echo cluster” struck—between October 2014 and March 2015, four more students from the same community committed suicide—it stopped me in my tracks. By this time, I had become a parent, and even though my own child was years from high school, I was already negotiating the delicate balance between praise and pressure, expectation and demand.<br><br>Soon after the second cluster, Palo Alto student Carolyn Walworth penned a widely-circulated op-ed that confirmed parents’ and educators’ worst fears. “As I sit in my room staring at the list of colleges…I can’t help but feel desolate,” Walworth wrote. “My stress began in elementary school, where students were segregated…as ‘early’ and ‘late’ readers…Middle school didn’t get any better. ” She wrote of having panic attacks and missed periods, as school-related stress manifested as physical illness: “We are not teenagers. We are lifeless bodies in a system that breeds competition, hatred, and discourages teamwork and genuine learning.”<br><br>Most Recent Stories<br><br>Seniors!

But Maya Murthy’s essay,in this issue of India Currents, suggests that much of what Walworth identifies is widely shared. “I couldn’t remember a single thing about them beyond a subject or two they’d excelled at,” Murthy writes of her freshman-year classmates. “[M]y worldview wasn’t sustainable, at least if I wanted to graduate with some sort of sanity.”<br><br>We cannot point to impassioned student writing and think that it is merely a product of teen angst. Adults are a big part of the problem, and the statistics confirm that these are widespread, community issues. In July 2016, the California Healthy Kids Survey found that “one-third of California’s 11th-graders and one-quarter of seventh-graders reported feeling chronically sad or hopeless over the past 12 months.” Earlier this year, Dr. Stuart Slavin of Saint Louis University School of Medicine announced the results of a wellness study he conducted at a major public high school in Fremont. 54% of students surveyed were suffering from depression. 80% showed moderate to severe anxiety levels.<br><br>I talked to Slavin about his findings. “My sense,” he told me, “is that parents are generally motivated…by wanting what is best for their children. The problem [is] that their view of what is ‘best’ is in my opinion often too narrow and in some ways misguided.” He noted that Indian American parents in particular, given the highly competitive environment around college admissions in India, might believe that “the more prestigious/elite the college that a student gets into, the better path that puts this student on in life.” But increased pressure can have serious effects on children’s mental health. Are the possible costs of depression, eating disorders, self-injurious behavior, and other adverse outcomes worth it? “What we should be encouraging is a healthy pursuit of excellence,” Slavin says, “rather than a potentially damaging pursuit of perfection.”<br><br>When I first read Slavin’s report, it brought to mind studies that have found high rates of depression and suicidal tendencies among graduate students. I thought, too, of the demand for “effortless perfection” that haunts high achieving university students, especially young women, who are supposed to have, do, and be it all without manifesting effort or stress. Clearly, these problems are not contained in grades 9-12. When the over-burdened high schoolers reach college, the anxiety, unhealthy habits, and burden of expectation come with them.<br><br>Slavin confirmed my anecdotal suspicions, noting that “depression in adolescence is associated with a higher risk of depression in adulthood.” He added: “Parents can’t be comfortable in the belief that their [high school students] will be fine after they get through with all of this.” Well over half the college counseling directors surveyed in a 2014 study reported steady increases, since 2009, in college students with clinical depression and anxiety disorders. Every year, more students arrive at university on psychiatric medication.<br><br>After four years of high school lived in preparation for a fantasy future in that perfect college, college students find heightened challenges and new stresses—if, that is, they aren’t already entirely burned out. Now they must delay the development of deep relationships and practices of self-care for life post-college. “Real life,” they tell themselves, is what they’ll be living in the future, an imagined future that eclipses childhood years spent in a blur of anxiety and worry, a future that they will one day come to view as the ever-receding horizon of the unlived past.<br>In 2015, The Atlantic’s Hanna Rosin asked just what it was about the Silicon Valley that had created this particularly volatile pressure cooker. Her hypothesis? Affluence and Asian exceptionalism.<br><br>On the first point, Rosin cited the work of child development scholar, Suniya Luthar, who has shown that children from upper and upper-middle-class families evidence depression, anxiety, and high-risk behaviors like substance abuse and promiscuity at a rate two to three times the national average. As Luthar writes, “Affluence leads people to believe they are wholly responsible for their own success or failure…they believe that they can control most aspects of their lives…They come to expect perfection. This is a double illusion, since neither complete control nor perfection is possible.”<br><br>Obviously, not everyone in the Silicon Valley is wealthy. While researching this story, I read numerous, wrenching stories about Bay Area college students who can’t afford rent, and who have to choose between buying textbooks and eating dinner. 20% of San Jose State University students surveyed in one study report “sometimes” or “often” not eating for a full day. Bay Area housing costs have driven countless families away from their communities; now, some students make commutes as long as 70 miles in order to remain in the schools they know. The students I teach at a land-grant university in Nevada face similar economic challenges. They ask for extensions on assignments because they can’t afford childcare or they’re simultaneously working two jobs.<br><br>Given the material challenges faced by these comparatively disadvantaged students, it can feel politically incorrect to dwell on what Luthar calls “The Problem with Rich Kids.” But there is a problem. A disproportionate number of students at the Silicon Valley’s elite public and private high schools are from wealthy families, and while it’s possible for wealthy people to raise well-adjusted children, what Luthar terms the “high rate of maladjustment among affluent adolescents” is a mounting concern. At issue are the development of “acquisitive” rather than “philanthropic” values, “narcissistic exhibitionism,” criminal behavior, shallow senses of self, extreme vulnerability to parental criticism, acute status consciousness, and inability to form close friendships. As Luthar warns,“[The] values [of today’s highly educated youth] will disproportionately shape norms in education, politics, and business.”<br><br>Then, there is the question of whether the dominance of Asians in these schools, including us Indians, is part of the problem. This is not a new charge. In 2005, the Wall Street Journal held up two high-performing Bay Area high schools as exemplary causes of “The New White Flight”: “Many white parents say they’re leaving because the schools are too academically driven…[The] schools, put…bluntly, are too Asian.”<br><br>In her reporting, Rosin found that “some non-Asian parents” still attribute the increased pressure in high school to the changing ethnic demographics of the Valley. One well-known Palo Alto high school is now 40% Asian; another in Saratoga is “about three-fifths Asian.” Four of the last nine students to commit suicide in Palo Alto were of Asian origin.<br><br>This is not an issue unique to the Silicon Valley. Amy Chua, the original “Tiger Mom,” lives in New Haven, Connecticut. In Anjali Enjeti’s recent telling, the problem extends to “ethno-burbs” all over the country, including her neighborhood of Johns Creek, Georgia, where whites are moving out of their school district for reasons like, “Asian parents take their kids for extra tutoring…My kids won’t get into a good college because of all of the Asians.” The tacit racism of such claims is the subject of Enjeti’s article. Less frequently discussed is how Asian students themselves are impacted by these trends. Too often, an Asian student’s “average” performance is construed as failure relative to that of “model” peers.<br><br>Silicon Valley high schools are increasingly attuned to this constellation of problems. In 2007, the “Stressed Out Schools” conference brought parents, educators, and researchers together to brainstorm stress reduction strategies like “‘college free’ zones in which [families] don’t discuss SAT scores, college applications, where you are applying.” Scholar Denise Clark Pope spearheaded the effort. “[High school students] are not mini-adults,” Pope stressed. “They have very different developmental needs…They need 9.5 hours of sleep each night…their brains are not fully developed, and their bodies are still changing…They’ll be ready for ‘reality’ soon enough.”<br><br>Slavin similarly advocates limiting homework, the amount of time that can be spent on extracurriculars, and the number of AP classes that students can take. This April, the Mercury News’ Sharon Noguchi reported that Bay Area schools are taking steps to “ease up on pressure” by changing school start-times and bringing therapy dogs to campus.<br><br>Are such measures effective? High schools are now trying to support depressed students, which is commendable, but depression is a symptom of the crisis—not the underlying cause. In our exchange, Slavin stressed that the idea that “depression is a disease or an illness” is itself part of the problem. “Depression,” he said, “is often what’s called reactive; it is produced or at least initiated by the toxicity of the environment. When viewed purely as an illness, it lets all of us off the hook…We should be looking at this crisis as an environmental health issue.”<br><br>Put differently, a teenager driven to despair by school stress is not an example of individual pathology. It’s not a parenting problem. It’s a communal plague in which many actors from teachers to college recruiters to coaches to parents to students, are complicit. This is the water in which we now swim. And everyone in question—from the Bay Area, to other ethno-burbs, to any one of many high-pressure, achievement-oriented, affluent, competitive communities—needs to move from a reactive mode to a proactive one, in which we are not simply, to paraphrase Walworth, “putting bandaids over gunshot wounds,” but actually getting rid of the guns.<br>In the movies, the iconic American high school is one of prom queens and homecomings, football games and locker-room sociality. High school is the playground of independent, sexually liberated, seemingly “adult” teenagers whose parents are rarely seen on camera. College is a pervasive subtext, but never really the point.<br><br>When I started high school in 1999, it was immediately clear that my experience was not going to look like what I’d seen in the movies, and not just because I went to an all-girls Catholic school. My experience was different because, as an Indian American, I grew up in a community that does not view high school as a terminal degree or an end in itself. My mother often dismissed the importance Americans place on high school graduation, as if children become adults at 18, as if college were icing on the cake of maturation, and not the first stop in a journey of higher education that would, ideally in her view, extend beyond the first post-graduate degree.<br><br>And yet, the thing that saved me from the Silicon Valley pressure cooker is that I didn’t actually go to one of those high-stress schools. I went to a school that was good—some programs, like English and History, were excellent—but it was patently not, between 1999 and 2003, one of the Bay Area’s “best” high schools. Our average SAT scores were lower. We didn’t send students to the Intel Science search. Frankly, we didn’t have as many Asians. The majority of my classmates intended to remain in-state for college.<br><br>I couldn’t fetishize AP courses because there weren’t many, so I wrote for the school newspaper, started a column in this magazine, was selected for theMercury News’ Board of Contributors, and came into my own as a writer and thinker. I didn’t fetishize any particular college because our school had no admissions track record at any of them, and so when I got a university opportunity I didn’t expect, I could embrace it wholly.<br><br>As a Bay Area-bred Indian American, I feel sad saying this, but not being surrounded by other Indians was probably the making of me. Not going to a “better” high school was the making of me. Being a relatively big fish in a small pond was the making of me. Being surrounded by peers who had aspirations beyond getting into the highest-ranked college was the making of me. Having classmates for whom high school was potentially a terminal degree taught me something as well: to live life in the present, not to defer real learning, growth, and meaning to the next stage of life, when I would, finally, have “arrived.”<br><br>Times have changed. My old high school now resembles those more competitive schools, and I wonder if there’s any place left in the Valley, in the country, that hasn’t been touched by the pressure machine. I wonder, because I’m going to have to make hard decisions about my own child’s education soon enough. You may be making or living with such decisions now. I’m not worried about my daughter’s grades, how much she eventually earns, or what college she goes to. At three, she is already radiantly bright and driven. All I can ever ask of her is that she become more fully herself.<br><br>But I do worry about us parents, educators, and community members. Will we be able to recreate an educational system that values curiosity, openness to failure, and engagement in the world? And, when we do, will we defend it?<br><br>Ragini Tharoor Srinivasan is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Nevada, Reno.

Whatever the person may have done, you still feel for them. <br><br><br>Dealing with an outsider who is envious of you is easy, but with a close relative, it is harsh.<br><br>Some of the best tools that you may try to mend the broken bonding are as follows:<br><br>Open communication is the key <br>Ask the member politely why they feel jealous and what you can do to decrease their negative feelings about you.<br><br><br>Address the issue in a calm and peaceful manner<br>Do not overreact to what they said immediately.

However, most experience jealousy as a weakness or lack of self-confidence. <br><br>Let them own it and become curious about their claims<br>While difficult, it can be helpful to observe how the jealousy may be playing out in the family member experiencing it. With some reflection, you may discover it has nothing to do with you. It may merit nothing more than compassion. <br><br>Sometimes, if we take ownership of jealous accusations that do not belong to us, we may deprive our family members of the opportunity the jealousy brings to them. Let them own it and become curious about their claims without becoming defensive.<br><br>Communicate with vulnerability<br>Vulnerability is often tricky, especially in the spotlight of a jealous family member. <br><br>Expressions such as: <br><br>“I feel uncomfortable.“<br>“I can see that you’re hurting, which makes me sad.“<br>“I feel agitated and accused.” <br>are potent phrases in interacting with jealous relatives. <br><br>These types of responses provide positive utility, often inoculating the intensity of the jealous family member. This approach can be challenging to “hold space” for the passion of jealousy. <br><br>However, vulnerability often leads to understanding by creating secure bonds and liberating the intensity of jealousy.<br><br>Set appropriate and healthy boundaries<br>Setting healthy boundaries is a way to support the relationship. <br><br>A jealous partner may request for another family member to behave in a way that reduces their anxiety.

Taking ownership of such behavior may be the fast track to resolving problematic jealousy.<br><br>Joanne Frederick, EdD, NCC, LPC, LCPC<br><br>Joanne Frederick<br>Licensed Mental Health Counselor, JFL & Associates Counseling Services LLC | Author, “Copeology“<br><br>A jealous family member can manifest in many ways. It could be:<br><br>Doing something as small as not congratulating you on your accomplishments.<br>Making snide comments about how easy your life is or one-upping you every chance they get. <br>Trying to sabotage relationships<br>There are also many reasons a family member might find themselves envying you. It could come from:<br><br>Feeling inadequate<br>Having less money<br>Feeling less attractive<br>Not having a significant other<br>Not succeeding in a career<br>Having an unhappy marriage<br>Or simply being unfulfilled<br><br><br>Have a conversation with them about this issue<br>A cousin may feel jealous of you after being constantly compared to you by their parents while growing up. An aunt might feel insecure after seeing you get ahead at work or in a relationship while struggling in these areas of their lives.<br><br>If you find yourself dealing with a jealous family member, the first thing to do is have a conversation with them about this issue:<br><br>Calmly let them know what you’ve noticed<br>Acknowledge how they may be feeling<br>Don’t blame anyone’s party<br>Avoid them or put them on an information diet<br>If they continue with their behavior after attempts to “clear the air,” it may be best to avoid them. <br><br>However, if that’s not possible, it’s best to put them on an information diet—limit what they know about your life. This gives them less ammo when things may not be going well for you, and it gives them fewer reasons to be jealous of you. <br><br><br><br>If you speak with them, try to keep the focus of the conversation on their lives instead of yours.<br><br>Jisun Sunny Fisher, PhD, MA, CHt, CAPP<br><br>Jisun Sunny Fisher<br>Psychologist, Purpose Coach, and Founder, Bodhifully | Author, “The Bodhi Blueprint“<br><br>Determine why that person or the relationship is so important to you<br>Believe it or not, some of us have a much more deeply-seeded fear of being successful vs. failure because of how our relationships might change. <br><br>Jealousy and envy come across in many forms, and although they can seem innocuous, they might be more detrimental than you think. <br><br><br><br>When we’re subconsciously afraid of a loved one becoming jealous of our wins, we’re significantly less likely to strive for these kinds of successes. <br><br>Relationships, especially with those in our family, unconsciously mirror and reflect our most deeply-rooted insecurities. Receiving love, support, and encouragement are almost always more important than realizing our potential. <br><br>Related: How to Stop Being Insecure About Yourself?<br><br>If you find yourself becoming aware of being hyper-conscious about how others will respond to your success, I suggest the following: <br><br>Determine why that person or the relationship is so important to you.<br>Understand their insecurities—why might they get jealous?<br>Take a look in the mirror, gaze into your eyes and say the following aloud: “I am not responsible for anyone else’s happiness.

Be kind to yourself and be mindful of what you need in these situations. <br><br>Chaye McIntosh<br><br>Chaye McIntosh<br>Clinical Director, ChoicePoint<br><br>Jealousy is inevitable between family members. Where is a family, there will always be jealousy, no matter how close or close-knit you all seem. <br><br>Being jealous does not always mean that the family member might despise you; it could also mean that they want to achieve more than you do. <br><br>Often, jealousy should be taken as a healthy thing so people can be productive and instill positive competition. But that is ever rarely the case, honestly. <br><br>So if you are worried about family members who openly show they are jealous of you, here are some tips to deal with them:<br><br>Try not to show off your or your children’s success in front of them<br>If you do talk about your achievements, try to downplay them. Don’t give already jealous people more reasons to hate you. <br><br>If you can, avoid them<br>When it comes to family members, I know it is hard not to see their faces every Christmas, but try not to boast about all the things you did the past year. <br><br>Take their sarcasm like a pro<br>Most of the time, when family members are jealous of each other, they will try to taunt or be sarcastic. Take their sarcasm like a pro; no need to be hurt. They are jealous of you for a reason. <br><br>Always remember: People who are jealous of you, deep down, wish they were you.<br><br>Let their jealousy slide<br>Remember, you worked hard for the things that you have in your life now. Be proud of your achievements and let their jealousy slide. Do not let anyone or their jealousy make you feel hurt or ashamed.<br><br>Laura Rippeon, LCSW-C<br><br>Laura Rippeon<br>Owner, Calm Waters Counseling<br><br>Be open to a conversation and hear each other out<br>Can it be worked out?<br><br>If you have the time, energy, and interest in investing in this relationship, is it worthwhile to have a conversation and work through any issues that may be causing the jealous feelings? <br><br>It would require both parties to be open to a conversation and hear each other out. While it may not solve the problems, communicating in a healthy way can eliminate assumptions and misunderstandings.<br><br>Limit your time or the information you share <br>If your jealous family member treats you unkindly, it’s okay to set some boundaries. Limiting your time around them or the information you share is helpful. <br><br>Also, let them know their behaviors towards you are not okay with you, and because of this, you are choosing to put X boundary into place.<br><br>Keep your values in mind<br>Knowing your values and allowing your values to help guide your choices in life is helpful and important. <br><br>This can be especially true when others may not agree with your choices or outwardly express their feelings of jealousy in an unhealthy manner towards you. <br><br>Remember, this is your life—not theirs—so use your values as your own North Star. <br><br>Related: What Are Core Values and How Do They Control My Life?<br><br>Remember that their jealousy is not yours to own<br>You are not in control of anyone else; their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all their own. <br><br>If someone else experiences a feeling, that’s okay. It’s not up to you to manage those feelings or work through those feelings for them. <br><br>So as long as you are content with your choices, their jealousy is not yours to own, so there is no need to take it personally.<br><br>Hillary Schoninger, LCSW<br><br>Hillary Schoninger<br>Owner, Water For Your Garden<br><br>Jealousy is a spectrum that all of us will be on some time within our lifetime. Whether we are the ones who are being envied or are envying someone else, jealousy is a universal feeling and experience. <br><br>More often than not, some of our first and most visceral experiences with jealousy come from our family. <br><br>Jealousy can happen for many reasons, and the more productive focus is coping with jealousy rather than trying to understand the rationales.  <br><br>Don’t take it personally<br>When someone in your family is jealous, thinking about it from a stance of it not being your business can be extremely powerful. <br><br>Of course, it is hurtful to receive this treatment, but if you can employ your boundaries while not absorbing this hurt, you are serving yourself and what you have achieved.  <br><br>Employ compassion<br>Modeling compassion to those who are envious can be rewarding. In addition, when we can employ compassion, we are not engaging in the negativity that jealousy offers.<br><br>Keep going<br>Use the experience of jealousy to see your resiliency in action. <br><br>Whatever you have achieved is valuable to you and is something you worked hard on. Enjoy the fruits of your labors while keeping your motivation and goals in place. <br><br>You are entitled to accomplish whatever you want without considering the opinions of others.<br><br>Claire Grayson<br><br>Claire Grayson<br>Article Writer and Psychology Major Student, Personality Max<br><br>There can be millions of reasons for jealousy in family members like:<br><br>Inferioriority<br>Feelings of unimportance <br>Personal traumas <br>And most of the time, it is just there without any valid reason. Let me give you a few ideas on how to deal with such people:<br><br>Communicate when they are calm<br>This will depend totally on your sixth sense that talking to such a person to resolve the issue will be effective or cause more issues. <br><br>When they are calm, try to discuss the issues and resolve the conflict in a friendly manner. Some people don’t like confrontation, and it can cause more problems, so better to ignore them.<br><br>Keep quiet<br>This is the best advice that I have ever had. Do not discuss with everyone your: <br><br>Failures<br>Success<br>Good news<br>Blessings <br>Try to share them with limited people (most trusted) if required.<br><br>Don’t feel guilty<br>Don’t feel guilty for not involving everyone; sometimes, it’s best to love someone from far away.<br><br>Go for a non-confrontational approach<br>Most of the time, they will try to make you anxious, upset, and hurt your feelings. So try to avoid confrontation go for a walk etc.<br><br>Limit interaction<br>This is the best option for you to limit your interaction with them. Do not force them to solve it.

We all want to be seen as the family member who has it all together, whether about: <br><br>A stable career<br>A long-term partner<br>A thriving social life<br>This means that when we are not achieving this, and one of our family members is, we can quickly become jealous of them as we are self-conscious about how we are being perceived compared to them.<br><br>Related: How to Stop Comparing Yourself to Others (And What to Do Instead)<br><br>What does jealousy look like in family members?<br><br>Jealous family members may belittle you for your achievements as they don’t know how to cope with your success. <br><br>For example, one of my clients is a successful entrepreneur whose brother constantly mocks her new projects and makes hurtful comments such as, “You’re not as successful as you think you are,” as he is insecure about his lack of success. <br><br>Jealous family members may also distance themselves from you and stop inviting you to family events as they don’t want to be outshined by you. <br><br>It is also common for them to gossip between themselves about how you are doing and what you have achieved, and this is because they feel better about themselves when they are putting you down; it means the attention is not on their lives and their achievements.<br><br>Don’t bother trying to win them around<br>Try to remember that jealousy is linked to a lack of confidence. <br><br>Therefore, you aren’t intentionally doing anything to bring about the jealousy; it will naturally arise as long as you possess a trait that someone else wishes they had. <br><br>This means you cannot control the jealousy of your family members, so don’t bother trying to win them around.<br><br>Take care of yourself by distancing yourself where necessary <br>If you know that attending a family gathering will only result in feeling bad about yourself, perhaps decide to sit it out and spend time with people who uplift you rather than knocking your confidence.<br><br>Stay neutral and don’t give them the emotions they want<br>Another tip is to stay neutral when your family members mock you. This is difficult to do as you will naturally want to jump to your own defense, but if you do this, you are giving your family members space to criticize you further as they have already made their minds up about you. <br><br>If you stay neutral and don’t give them the emotions that they want, they are more likely to leave you alone in the future. However, if you do react in an emotional way, it is not your fault as this is very natural to do.<br><br>Angela Milnes<br><br>Angela Milnes<br>Qualified Psychology Teacher and Multi-Award-Winning Family Lifestyle Blogger | Founder, The Inspiration Edit<br><br>The best way to deal with jealous family members is to try to understand where they’re coming from and why they’re feeling that way. Once you understand their perspective, it’s easier to have empathy and compassion for them.<br><br>Acknowledge their feelings<br>The first step is to validate their feelings. You can say something like, “I see that you’re feeling jealous, and I’m sorry that you feel that way. Can you tell me more about why you’re feeling jealous?” <br><br>You might be surprised to find that their jealousy comes from a place of insecurity or fear rather than malice. <br><br>Remember, it’s not about you; it’s about them. You can’t control how they feel, but you can try to understand where they’re coming from.<br><br>Avoid comparisons<br>One of the best things you can do is avoid comparisons. It only serves to make people feel worse about themselves. <br><br>So instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your unique gifts and talents. And instead of comparing your family member’s accomplishments to theirs, celebrate them for their achievements.<br><br>Help them find other outlets for their jealousy<br>Jealousy is often rooted in insecurity and fear. So one way to help jealous family members is to help them find other outlets for their jealousy. <br><br>This could include things like: <br><br>Encouraging them to pursue their passions and interests<br>Helping them find a support group or therapy<br>Don’t enable their jealousy<br>Finally, it’s important not to enable their jealousy. This means not feeding into their jealous feelings by gossiping about other people or engaging in other negative behaviors. <br><br>It also means not tolerating their jealous behavior if it starts to become harmful. If you see that someone is beginning to act out their jealousy in a dangerous way, it’s crucial to get help from a professional.<br><br>Clyde Guilamo<br><br>Clyde Guilamo<br>Property Tax Lawyer<br><br>Downplay everything<br>Let people know that although things may appear grand, it’s not true. Everyone struggles:<br><br>If you have a nice house, talk about how the expenses are so high.<br>If you have a large retirement account, talk about how that money is frozen, and you can’t access it until much, much later. <br>If one of your videos on youtube goes viral, talk about how you didn’t see any money because you don’t have enough subscribers. <br>If you have a successful business, talk about how the state, the federal government, the issuance company, and all these other agencies have their hands in your pocket, keeping you broke. <br>Give away the credit<br>Make it seem like you lucked out. <br><br>If you have a successful business, talk about how fortunate you were that “Juan” was looking for a job when you were hiring.

Sometimes, jealousy comes because people think that you didn’t earn it. <br><br>When they hear about the work you put into getting your success, they may quickly realize that they don’t have your work ethic. <br><br>Joel Jackson<br><br>Joel Jackson<br>Entrepreneur and Co-founder, Lifeforce<br><br>Dig deeply and find out the cause of the jealousy<br>There is nothing worse than dreading the time you’re about to spend with family, whether it’s during the holidays or at weddings or other planned gatherings.

One of those bandmates was his older brother—the one who was more handsome and more accomplished than John when the two were growing up. <br><br>Then, suddenly, John took control of the band because he was the one with the talent and vision to lead it. He was the songwriter, singer, and lead guitarist, while Tom was relegated to playing rhythm guitar. <br><br>It was a jarring experience for Tom, and John didn’t realize it until it was too late.

Don’t be afraid to compliment them both openly and indirectly. <br><br>Praise them in front of their relatives and talk well of them. It’s natural for us to gravitate toward folks who compliment us. Your praise will attract them to you, and you will be protected from their wickedness. <br>Sending them a present is another approach to alleviate this jealousy. Gifts cause people to fall in love with one other.

Only some men use violence against women. Most men think that violence against women is never acceptable.<br><br>Men are also victims of violence, however most of the time men and boys are victims of violence by other men.<br><br>Research shows there is a clear link between men's violence against women and gender inequality. A 2014 report by VicHealth found 19% of Australians think men should be in control in relationships and be the head of the household. The report also says:<br><br>"Gender equity is key to ending violence against women. The strongest predictor of high levels of violence against women is unequal power between men and women."<br><br>Other factors that add to the likelihood and severity of men's violence against women include:<br><br>discrimination<br>experience of and exposure to violence<br>alcohol and substance use<br>some cultural and religious practices<br>lack of knowledge of Australian laws<br>loss of traditional family and community support systems.<br>What is gender inequality?<br>Men often have more power and higher status than women. We see this at home, in the workplace and in the community. For example:<br><br>if the husband is 'head of the family', he may make all the decisions<br>men are traditionally the 'breadwinners' while women are the 'stay at home mums'<br>only about one-third of managers in Australia are female<br>the gender pay gap means men are paid more than women, even though they do the same work<br>This imbalance is know as gender inequality. Violence against women is more accepted in societies where men and women are not equal.<br><br>Gender norms and gender stereotypes also contribute to gender inequality<br>This is when society has expectations of how males and females should behave.<br><br>For men, this means feeling pressured to be dominant, in control, strong and powerful.<br><br>For women, this means expectations to be submissive and 'pick up the pieces'.<br><br>Gender stereotyping also starts at a young age for both girls and boys. For example, T-shirts for girls that say "princess" while T-shirts for boys say "future scientist".<br><br>The cycle of violence starts with disrespect<br>Not all disrespect towards women results in violence. But all violence against women starts with disrespectful behaviour.<br><br>Disrespect starts with beliefs and attitudes we develop from a young age. Without realising it, we can sometimes say and do things that make young people think disrespectful and aggressive behaviours are acceptable.<br><br>As parents, extended family members, teachers, employers and as individuals we can all be positive role models for children and young people. Together as a community, we can help stop the cycle of violence against women.<br><br>WATCH: Let's change the story — Violence against women in Australia<br>This is the story of how gender inequality contributes to the murder of around one Australian woman almost every week.<br><br><br><br>(Video from Our Watch)<br><br>WATCH: Attitudes to gender equality and violence against women<br>As long as we all continue to see women as less equal to men, disrespect and violence against women will continue to happen.<br><br><br><br>(Video from VicHealth)<br><br>The facts about domestic and family violence in Australia<br>On average, 1 woman a week is killed by their current or former partner.<br>Women are more likely to experience violence from men they know, often in the home.<br>1 in 3 women experience physical or sexual violence, or both, perpetrated by someone they know.<br>Police deal with an average of 657 domestic violence matters every day — that's one every 2 minutes.<br>Domestic or family violence against women is the biggest reason women  — and their children — are homeless.<br>Almost all acts of rape and sexual assault are committed by men towards women.<br>8 out of 10 women aged 18 to 24 were harassed on the street in the past year.<br>87 percent of young women changed their behaviour to ensure their own safety in the past year.<br>SOURCE: The Line, NSW Police<br><br>What you can do to reject violence and promote respect<br>1. Be aware: Stop it at the start<br>As parents and role models of young people, we want the best for kids. We want them to have positive experiences, healthy relationships and opportunities to learn. We want them to understand right and wrong. We want them to respect others, and respect themselves.<br><br>Even though most Australians recognise that violence against women is a serious issue, fewer people realise that the behaviours and attitudes can start in childhood. Our beliefs about male and female relationships are learned, and can be passed onto the next generation.<br><br>Adults have the strongest influence on young people’s attitudes about disrespect towards women. But when we see it in action, we tend not to get involved. Without realising it, what we say and do is shaping young peoples’ views about more serious behaviours.<br><br>The Respect website has resources, which are printable, to help you have these difficult but important conversations with young people, including:<br><br>The Conversation Guide<br>The Respect Checklist<br>The Line website also has a helpful article about talking to young kids about gender stereotypes.<br><br>The following video shows how disrespectful behaviour can impact children.<br><br><br><br>(Video from Australian Government Department of Social Services)<br><br>2. Stop the excuses<br>Take a moment to reflect on the common ways we excuse disrespectful and aggressive behaviour, including:<br><br>playing down disrespectful or aggressive behaviour, such as "don't worry, it wasn't that bad" or "suck it up, princess"<br>accepting aggression as just part of being a boy, for example "boys will be boys" and "oh you know how boys are like, they're a bit rough"<br>blaming girls by saying, "it takes 2 to tango" or "what did you do to make him angry?"<br>raising girls to accept disrespect by saying things such as "it's okay, he probably did it because he likes you"<br>These phrases seem harmless when we say it or hear others say it, but children and young people can interpret them in ways we don't intend.<br><br>Have you ever thought or said...	What a young person might think<br>"It's just a joke"	Girl: I shouldn't get upset about this<br>Boy: It's okay to make sexist jokes<br>"It's tough being a boy"	Girl: It's okay for boys to disrespect me<br>Boy: It's not my fault if she makes me angry<br>"She probably provoked him"	Girl: I caused this<br>Boy: She asked for it<br>"You're so whipped"	Boy: I shouldn't value what my girlfriend wants to do<br>"She's a feisty one"	Girl: I shouldn't give my opinion, I shouldn't stand up for myself<br>Read more about the hidden meanings of common expressions that can excuse disrespectful behaviour towards girls and women on the Respect website.<br><br>Speak up the next time someone says or does something that excuses disrespect towards women.<br><br>3. Stand up and speak out<br>We all need to help end the violence against women and children. We need to stand up and speak out. Remaining silent and not doing something about it means the violence will continue. Here are some ways White Ribbon Australia suggests you can speak out:<br><br>If you are with friends and someone says something that makes you uncomfortable or that you feel is wrong, you can say: “I’m not sure what you mean. What did you say?”<br>Sometimes people forget they are talking about a real person. To remind them and change the conversation, you can say: “What if this was your sister, mother, daughter, son?”<br>Give your opinion to show your disapproval: “I believe abusing a woman is wrong.”<br>If you are with a group of people, you’re probably not the only one feeling uncomfortable. Let others know they are not alone and encourage them to speak up by asking: “Am I the only one uncomfortable with this?”<br>If you talk to someone you think is violent to women, they will probably tell you to mind your own business, make excuses or deny it. If you see violence and abuse, and you feel safe, talk about the behaviour you have seen: “You are my friend but I think the way you criticise and intimidate her is wrong.”<br>The Our Watch website lists more ways you can help prevent violence against women and their children for:<br><br>Teens and young adults<br>Parents and caregivers<br>Men<br>Women<br>Professionals<br>4.

EIA estimates U.S. recoverable coal reserves at about 252 billion short tons, of which about 58% is underground mineable coal.<br>Recoverable reserves at producing mines are the amount of recoverable reserves that coal mining companies report to EIA for their U.S. coal mines that produced more than 25,000 short tons of coal in a year.
