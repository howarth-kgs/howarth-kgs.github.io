<td class="c s2em fSS bg2006SandDollar"><br>Posted by9 months ago<br><br>Is Indian society and culture ego and self driven?<br><br>￼<br><br>AskIndia<br><br>Idk why would this question come into my mind but as teenager who doesn't really have that many friends or any friends to interact to, I always have kind of looked at society with two frames. One through the internet YOUTUBE and other sources such as news and newspapers and the other what's happening around me, my family. I wasn't lucky(or maybe lucky) to have a neighborhood. There are literally no resedential houses or apartments near to my house, it's in the middle of a commercial area, and in the middle means the main road. So growing up I either had school kids to interact with, which because of my absolutely terrible ugly dark face, and a bit (or a lot of bullying), and my bellow average marks were the my self esteem never really stood up. I never really had a meaningful conversation with any fucking human being and talking to girls, can't even think about it. Sorry about my useless story, but wanted to tell you this because, my absolutely zero interaction with people didn't push me into this "Indian Culture" and the norms and regulations most Indians follow unconsciously. Me now a somewhat mature teen, was having this question - That is our society is ego driven. It seems to me like, everything(most of the people) do in this country is just show things off to people and get validation from them. it's like the reason for most people's existence. And you don't just these effects from aunties and mums boozing about their kids or kids trying to show off their pencil box and water bottles. I think it can also be seen at a higher scale, to how politicians work and policemen work. The thing that everyone wants is public recognition and validation. And this can be observed everywhere, just look around observe, people try to show off things brands selling you things to show off and countless other things. The thing that confuses me, is to how we became like this as we are now? Cause it can't be just colonisation or poverty because countries like South Korea Japan and Hong Kong have gone through the same. How did we became so social creatures that most of our actions and decisions are based upon opinions of others??? Writing this I think it could be Bollywood movies, I'm not that familiar with the movies before 2012, what do you think that could be a reason???<br><br>5 Comments<br><br>Share<br><br>Save<br><br>Hide<br><br>Report<br><br>90% Upvoted<br><br></td>

This stress is gone meanwhile. :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So it works for me out positively, that I use GO as a kind of anti-anxiety self therapy.

How is that possible ?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I stuck since nearby 2 years on 7kyu .... so I should state all long day here conspiracies, state fake news and practise mobbing, bashing steadily, hm ?<br>[Unknown]A new version of CGoban is available that includes several bug fixes and enhancements, please visit https://kgsai.com/downloads to download the update.<br>Epsilion [3k?]no, just smoke some weed Linux<br>LinuxGooo [7k]ah, yeah .... maybe thats the thing behind ... I never took drugs in my life beside tenin and caffein :-)<br>Khaleesi [-]good advice eps<br>okiol [1k]if it is genghis and genghis is a real person roughly as he has portrayed himself, then he does have high education... not that that would be relevant, but anyway<br>Epsilion [3k?]and read Kageyama<br>Bayesian [1k]Here is a short book on it, https://files.catbox.moe/u3xhd1.pdf<br>LinuxGooo [7k]tks ... I have most of the Go books. I suppose you mean Toshiro Kageyama, right ?<br>Epsilion [3k?]yeah<br>Epsilion [3k?]i need to reread it soon<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I can win here and there against 3k and 4k .... so technically I have the potentials. My problem is the "emotional state". Herewith I misjudge situations, do wrong assumptions and then miss the right/good moves. So its more a psychological thingy why I stuck.<br>Epsilion [3k?]he says in that book there is often a barrier at 7k, i had it too<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Fear, worries, anxiety .... lack of self confidence, underestimating own strength, overestimating opponent"s strength ... I think you know what I am talking about.<br>Epsilion [3k?]"fundamentals of go" i mean<br>Epsilion [3k?]that"s why he says at those times it"s good to go back to the fundamental principles<br>LinuxGooo [7k]In Game reviews, as I take my time, mostly I find the move on my own, which turned the game against me.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I do every week game reviews with a 3 Dan player ... and he also plays with me 13x13 training games.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]hm .... thats an interesting aspect, Epsilion. Strengthen the fundaments, to get own emotoins under control, hm.<br>okiol [1k]there are a few things i"d tell a 7k as general rules, but perhaps the most useful, that is easiest to study on one"s own, and which requires comparatively little work but which contributes greatly to the ability to judge a situation and also to kill and live, and that is learning the L shape in the corner, and the principle of 6 is dead, 7 is undecided, 8 is alive<br>LinuxGooo [7k]sure, reading skills have a big impact to avoid bigger losses.<br>okiol [1k]i frequently kill people around 1k-1d who don"t understand this properly, because i can see far ahead whether a group is going to die or not<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Rarely I lose my groups, doesnt happen very often in my games.<br>okiol [1k]it"s not about just reading as such, it"s a very specific set of let"s call them "shapes" that have to do with life and death that recurr frequently in games<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But more, because I "lack of aggressivity", I let live my opponent ... I am a very peaceful, gentle player. :-)<br>okiol [1k]and if you just know to look for them, they"re very common, even in games they never happen, they can be used for reading<br>alfalfa [4k]i was afk, but it does my heart good to see people talking about... go... in here<br>Epsilion [3k?]yeah that"s rare eh<br>LinuxGooo [7k]My fears, worries, anxiety gets less over the years. Sometimes I even try "crazy stuff", just to move into a tough fighting to train my skills. In the beginning on KGS (in 01/2014) I had huge fears, I had to stand up and go away from the board when I have seen that I come into trouble. Felt like my pulse was on 180 ... similar to a live threatening situation. This stress is gone meanwhile. :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So it works for me out positively, that I use GO as a kind of anti-anxiety self therapy. I never played a Go game just for fun, beside Rengo. :-)<br>R<br>alfalfa [4k]<br>30:00 + 5×0:30<br>R<br>alfalfa [4k]<br>edson [6k]~<br>Animation [3k]yes Go is useful for passing the time a little<br>Animation [3k]I personally am indifferent to it<br>Epsilion [3k?]lol<br>Animation [3k]i do not see any value in go tbh<br>Animation [3k]either winning or losing it means nothing<br>LinuxGooo [7k]so you like to waste your time on KGS ?<br>Animation [3k]yes it"s like to sit at the park bench<br>Animation [3k]a socially acceptable way to spend some time with someone else<br>Animation [3k]but the game itself means nothing to me<br>LinuxGooo [7k]maybe you could also go out into a park and feed birds ....<br>clydesdale [2k]i am obsessed with go<br>alfalfa [4k]it"s intriguing, is it not?<br>clydesdale [2k]yes<br>clydesdale [2k]indeed<br>alfalfa [4k]the damndest thing i have ever seen<br>clydesdale [2k]it is a bit like maths<br>clydesdale [2k]puzzles<br>alfalfa [4k]yes very much so, i have been writing a go program now, for oh, around thirty years<br>alfalfa [4k]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1flvRhXQemadcFF8A3f805taB7EAYqrJq/view<br>alfalfa [4k]that is a screen-shot from a suite of programs i have written to play go<br>alfalfa [4k](the back-ground graphic is not mine,,, i swiped that from elsewhere<br>alfalfa [4k]the text on it is my program<br>okiol [1k]it really is quite amazing how much better of a game go is compared to chess<br>okiol [1k]i"ve played both a lot<br>okiol [1k]probably spent over a thousand hours practicing and playing both chess and go, but there is absolutely no comparison<br>okiol [1k]wait no there"s no way i could"ve spent that long<br>alfalfa [4k]chess master Ed Lasker (immanuel"s son i think) said that if space aliens exist, it is likely that they play go<br>clydesdale [2k]top level chess has far too many draws<br>okiol [1k]no more than 1000 seems right actually<br>clydesdale [2k]immanuel lasker said that go was a deeper game than chess and he was a world chess champion<br>okiol [1k]there is just an inherent horribleness to the game of chess, every game feels like getting locked down and waiting for a mistake<br>Bayesian [1k]Go can be elegant, chess is just brute force<br>okiol [1k]i think that is oversimplifying it though, i mean there is beauty in chess as well, and they are both both very strategical and tactical at the same time<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If I watch Chess players on YT, the forth and back moves again and gain look so akward for me. :-) I dont really like the concept of Chess to empty the board<br>R<br>clydesdale [2k]<br>20:00 + 5×0:30<br>okiol [1k]also, shogi seems like a superior chess-like game as well<br>okiol [1k]i"m unsure about xiangqi and jianggi<br>Bayesian [1k]Russians mimic chess with their war strategy<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Go is more like a Mandala .... laying out the stones, and over the time, you get a "nice picture"<br>R<br>clydesdale [2k]<br>akishio [2k]<br>clydesdale [2k]xiang- chi is more popular than wei- chi in china<br>okiol [1k]both chess and xiangqi have a huge advantage of go<br>okiol [1k]or several actually<br>Animation [3k]i am more interested with language than strategy games<br>okiol [1k]they"re both more intuitive and easier to get a general grasp of, as well as faster to play<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Go is also called "the silent hands"<br>LinuxGooo [7k]so Go is also a "non verbal communicatoin" between two players.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]kind of language, too<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Its like with music, a universal language being understood by every human. I can play Go with a Korean, Japanese, Chinese, European, Australian etc. ..... doesnt matter ... we understand each other (more less) behind the Goban. I like that.<br>Animation [3k]i see language as computation<br>okiol [1k]i just think it"s funny that chess is considered the "ultimate game for genuises" or whatever in much of the west, while there are so much more complex and beautiful old strategy board games...<br>Animation [3k]go is a type of computation also<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have my doubts, that Chess would be so popular without IBM nowadays.<br>Animation [3k]but i don"t like adversarial communications like Go, i prefer constructive communication<br>okiol [1k]i think IBM is a contingency. Chess is popular because it"s "the smart people"s game" in the west<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Deep Blue was developed between 1985-1989 and in a 6 game match with Garry Kasparov in 1996 and 1997, which got world wide attention in all medias, similar to what we have seen with AlphaGo, Chess was hyped a lot.<br>Animation [3k]I am amazed how a spoken sentence of a few words communicates do much meaning<br>Animation [3k]so much meaning and information from a short 4 second utterance<br>LinuxGooo [7k]People still talk about some key figures in Chess till today, e.g. legendary Bobby Fischer (US) ... he won in row 20 games during 1970 and 1971 ... and on top he had the "game of the century" in 1972 against Spassky.<br>Animation [3k]language to me represents an underdeveloped super power<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think Bobby Fischer was also the symbol for the "West" against Russian chess grandmaster Boris V. Spassky, during the times of "Cold War"<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Imagine, if we would have now a Russian 9 Pro Dan in GO, who would be beaten by an Ukrainian Pro Dan in a big match, with a price money of 10 million Euros (Garry Kasparov got a prize money of 1 million aganist IBM"s super computer Deep Blue if I remember right).<br>Animation [3k]chess is a game for egomaniacs<br>Animation [3k]what the world needs today is not ego but understanding<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think you mix something up, Animation.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Top Class people, whatever it is ... artists, sportsmen, athlets, musicians, business moguls, Chess grand masters, Go Pro Dans ... they have huge self confidence.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If you have to study 12 hours per day Chess or GO, I think you become very devote and humble ... same as you practise 6-8 hours an instrument ....<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Over the time, with being encouraged by parents, by good teachers, by mentors, by success, such a person gets more and more confident in own skills ... and fearless. That might look for you like an egomaniac.<br>alfalfa [4k]i want to remind everyone that even if i remain silent. i may have very strong opinions. just not choosing to share.<br>alfalfa [4k]at the moment.<br>alfalfa [4k]i was playing go, while you were streaming<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have interviewed greatest musicians, on stage they are like titans, but if you meet them privately, behind the stage ... they are mostly very quiet introvertede people.<br>alfalfa [4k]so don;t think "of course alfalfa agrees with me"<br>okiol [1k]i think you"d better just share what you disagree with instead, alfalfa<br>alfalfa [4k]i am not required to do so.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]oh.. I didnt notice, that Animatoin has gone again.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I didnt want end in a monologue ... tss.....<br>alfalfa [4k]yeah i think i scared him off<br>okiol [1k]i don"t think anyone was assuming that you were agreeing with anything in particular, but if you want to proclaim your disagreements, then just do so instead of posting these hints?<br>alfalfa [4k]my work here is done.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]you sound like an old mafia boss, alfalfa<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Just missing, that you end your final statement with "Basta"<br>alfalfa [4k]heh<br>alfalfa [4k]i didn"t like those movies because the characters were not played by the same actors in each film<br>alfalfa [4k]they would have been much better if that consistency had been achieved<br>LinuxGooo [7k]alfalfa: My work here is done (in las vegas).

The Grill hangs outside the boat. So he just can turn it 90 degrees, and all the hot coal falls into the water.<br>Khaleesi [-]cooking on coal is the best<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am more worried as neighbour on my wooden boat *laugh*<br>LinuxGooo [7k]its not just an open grill he has, He has a Lid too<br>R<br>clydesdale [2k]<br>15:00 + 5×0:30<br>LinuxGooo [7k]"Magma Marine Barbeque Original" is the model, I think.<br>alfalfa [4k]i wonder if you could build a grill that remains level, maybe using electrical gyroscopes, or even just floating in a fluid<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am not a griller ... it never became my passion.<br>Khaleesi [-]you"d just need a counterweight<br>clydesdale [2k]i am more of a chimpanzee than a griller<br>LinuxGooo [7k]we have cardanic gimbaled mountings for our ovens inside the galley (kitchen) on boats.

So a compass needs to be gimbaled against all 3 axes, its not related to the latitude. What you might mean is the so called "magnetic compensatoin", which has two factors: ship magnetism, and earth magnetism (related to longitude and latitude = position of the ship).<br>Bayesian [1k]right, and otherwise the compass is automatically balanced when manufactured<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the course of the ship finally defines the concrete value of "magnetic compensatoin", a correcting parameter we calculate to define the ship course (magnetic course) from the chart / map course.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The mounting on the ship itself depends a lot on the ship magnetism. Not every mounting system is adequate. A compass is always adapted individually to each ship. Its veryx expensive to install a compass, as it needs specialists who are allowed to do it. And give the compass on the ship a certificate.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Couple of years ago I worked on a 2 masted steel ship, its compass was total worthless. Because of a strike in a thunderstorm, the hull + superstructure (both made of steel) became so extreme magnetized, that no compass could be used. We only navigated with GPS.

How is that possible ?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I stuck since nearby 2 years on 7kyu .... so I should state all long day here conspiracies, state fake news and practise mobbing, bashing steadily, hm ?<br>[Unknown]A new version of CGoban is available that includes several bug fixes and enhancements, please visit https://kgsai.com/downloads to download the update.<br>Epsilion [3k?]no, just smoke some weed Linux<br>LinuxGooo [7k]ah, yeah .... maybe thats the thing behind ... I never took drugs in my life beside tenin and caffein :-)<br>Khaleesi [-]good advice eps<br>okiol [1k]if it is genghis and genghis is a real person roughly as he has portrayed himself, then he does have high education... not that that would be relevant, but anyway<br>Epsilion [3k?]and read Kageyama<br>Bayesian [1k]Here is a short book on it, https://files.catbox.moe/u3xhd1.pdf<br>LinuxGooo [7k]tks ... I have most of the Go books. I suppose you mean Toshiro Kageyama, right ?<br>Epsilion [3k?]yeah<br>Epsilion [3k?]i need to reread it soon<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I can win here and there against 3k and 4k .... so technically I have the potentials. My problem is the "emotional state". Herewith I misjudge situations, do wrong assumptions and then miss the right/good moves. So its more a psychological thingy why I stuck.<br>Epsilion [3k?]he says in that book there is often a barrier at 7k, i had it too<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Fear, worries, anxiety .... lack of self confidence, underestimating own strength, overestimating opponent"s strength ... I think you know what I am talking about.<br>Epsilion [3k?]"fundamentals of go" i mean<br>Epsilion [3k?]that"s why he says at those times it"s good to go back to the fundamental principles<br>LinuxGooo [7k]In Game reviews, as I take my time, mostly I find the move on my own, which turned the game against me.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I do every week game reviews with a 3 Dan player ... and he also plays with me 13x13 training games.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]hm .... thats an interesting aspect, Epsilion. Strengthen the fundaments, to get own emotoins under control, hm.<br>okiol [1k]there are a few things i"d tell a 7k as general rules, but perhaps the most useful, that is easiest to study on one"s own, and which requires comparatively little work but which contributes greatly to the ability to judge a situation and also to kill and live, and that is learning the L shape in the corner, and the principle of 6 is dead, 7 is undecided, 8 is alive<br>LinuxGooo [7k]sure, reading skills have a big impact to avoid bigger losses.<br>okiol [1k]i frequently kill people around 1k-1d who don"t understand this properly, because i can see far ahead whether a group is going to die or not<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Rarely I lose my groups, doesnt happen very often in my games.<br>okiol [1k]it"s not about just reading as such, it"s a very specific set of let"s call them "shapes" that have to do with life and death that recurr frequently in games<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But more, because I "lack of aggressivity", I let live my opponent ... I am a very peaceful, gentle player. :-)<br>okiol [1k]and if you just know to look for them, they"re very common, even in games they never happen, they can be used for reading<br>alfalfa [4k]i was afk, but it does my heart good to see people talking about... go... in here<br>Epsilion [3k?]yeah that"s rare eh<br>LinuxGooo [7k]My fears, worries, anxiety gets less over the years. Sometimes I even try "crazy stuff", just to move into a tough fighting to train my skills. In the beginning on KGS (in 01/2014) I had huge fears, I had to stand up and go away from the board when I have seen that I come into trouble. Felt like my pulse was on 180 ... similar to a live threatening situation. This stress is gone meanwhile. :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So it works for me out positively, that I use GO as a kind of anti-anxiety self therapy.

I can play Go with a Korean, Japanese, Chinese, European, Australian etc. ..... doesnt matter ... we understand each other (more less) behind the Goban. I like that.<br>Animation [3k]i see language as computation<br>okiol [1k]i just think it"s funny that chess is considered the "ultimate game for genuises" or whatever in much of the west, while there are so much more complex and beautiful old strategy board games...<br>Animation [3k]go is a type of computation also<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have my doubts, that Chess would be so popular without IBM nowadays.<br>Animation [3k]but i don"t like adversarial communications like Go, i prefer constructive communication<br>okiol [1k]i think IBM is a contingency. Chess is popular because it"s "the smart people"s game" in the west<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Deep Blue was developed between 1985-1989 and in a 6 game match with Garry Kasparov in 1996 and 1997, which got world wide attention in all medias, similar to what we have seen with AlphaGo, Chess was hyped a lot.<br>Animation [3k]I am amazed how a spoken sentence of a few words communicates do much meaning<br>Animation [3k]so much meaning and information from a short 4 second utterance<br>LinuxGooo [7k]People still talk about some key figures in Chess till today, e.g. legendary Bobby Fischer (US) ... he won in row 20 games during 1970 and 1971 ... and on top he had the "game of the century" in 1972 against Spassky.<br>Animation [3k]language to me represents an underdeveloped super power<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think Bobby Fischer was also the symbol for the "West" against Russian chess grandmaster Boris V. Spassky, during the times of "Cold War"<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Imagine, if we would have now a Russian 9 Pro Dan in GO, who would be beaten by an Ukrainian Pro Dan in a big match, with a price money of 10 million Euros (Garry Kasparov got a prize money of 1 million aganist IBM"s super computer Deep Blue if I remember right).<br>Animation [3k]chess is a game for egomaniacs<br>Animation [3k]what the world needs today is not ego but understanding<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think you mix something up, Animation.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Top Class people, whatever it is ... artists, sportsmen, athlets, musicians, business moguls, Chess grand masters, Go Pro Dans ... they have huge self confidence.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If you have to study 12 hours per day Chess or GO, I think you become very devote and humble ... same as you practise 6-8 hours an instrument ....<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Over the time, with being encouraged by parents, by good teachers, by mentors, by success, such a person gets more and more confident in own skills ... and fearless. That might look for you like an egomaniac.<br>alfalfa [4k]i want to remind everyone that even if i remain silent. i may have very strong opinions. just not choosing to share.<br>alfalfa [4k]at the moment.<br>alfalfa [4k]i was playing go, while you were streaming<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have interviewed greatest musicians, on stage they are like titans, but if you meet them privately, behind the stage ... they are mostly very quiet introvertede people.<br>alfalfa [4k]so don;t think "of course alfalfa agrees with me"<br>okiol [1k]i think you"d better just share what you disagree with instead, alfalfa<br>alfalfa [4k]i am not required to do so.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]oh..

So a compass needs to be gimbaled against all 3 axes, its not related to the latitude. What you might mean is the so called "magnetic compensatoin", which has two factors: ship magnetism, and earth magnetism (related to longitude and latitude = position of the ship).<br>Bayesian [1k]right, and otherwise the compass is automatically balanced when manufactured<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the course of the ship finally defines the concrete value of "magnetic compensatoin", a correcting parameter we calculate to define the ship course (magnetic course) from the chart / map course.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The mounting on the ship itself depends a lot on the ship magnetism. Not every mounting system is adequate. A compass is always adapted individually to each ship. Its veryx expensive to install a compass, as it needs specialists who are allowed to do it. And give the compass on the ship a certificate.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Couple of years ago I worked on a 2 masted steel ship, its compass was total worthless. Because of a strike in a thunderstorm, the hull + superstructure (both made of steel) became so extreme magnetized, that no compass could be used. We only navigated with GPS.

So Ukraine could not locate the Russian drones. Ukraine accused DJI to support Russian army that way.<br>PepperX [7k]China support ru? That cannot be!<br>Meepy [-]whats a dji?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]a Drone company in China<br>LinuxGooo [7k]DJI = Da-Jiang Innovations.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]world biggest drone manufacturer<br>LinuxGooo [7k]so far we talk about "consumer drones" :-)<br>Alex1888 [3k]i wonder how china has sold it to ukraine at all... not a friendly behaviour, haha :)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Many of the DJI drones came from donators in the West ....<br>PepperX [7k]DJI drones are widely re-sold by distributors, and as LGooo said, it"s a consumer drone, for recreational purposes.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]As soon DJI noticed it, that people bought complete stocks in Western shops, DJI pulled back. Saying, that their drones are not for military use.<br>PepperX [7k]And how is the drone firmware updated?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am not in this Drone business. I even dont have a drone on my own. So no idea how that is going<br>Alex1888 [3k]through the pc<br>Alex1888 [3k]by usb cable<br>PepperX [7k]Apple and Google update your phone when and as they like.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Ist just clicking the "update" button of the installed software I suppose<br>PepperX [7k]And the flash ROM image that is used to update the drone"s firmware, the image file on your PC, where does that come from?<br>Alex1888 [3k]from the manufacturer<br>PepperX [7k]Yes,<br>LinuxGooo [7k]you get the app on Google play, check "dJI Go app". after installation, you just select, what kind of drone you have, and then click the firmware update button. thats it<br>PepperX [7k]OK. Sounds totally safe.<br>Alex1888 [3k]there are special programs to load the firmware<br>LinuxGooo [7k]For computer its the "DJI Assistant 2", you get it on dji.com as download<br>PepperX [7k]There are also special programs to decompile/disassemble the firmware, but that is not for kyu level droners.......not even for lower dan level droners.<br>Alex1888 [3k]haha<br>Alex1888 [3k]yes, but its not that difficult, after all<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Today I wanted make a photo of our summer place, I had to enter the private ground of a steel company. So I asked the staff if I can go to the pier to make a photo. They said "no". So what I will do now I organize a Drone, and voila I will get my pics by a fly over on a weekend on this ground. :-)<br>Meepy [-]bad idea, asking for permission<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I had to .... the staff has seen me ... imagine, you come along with your bike, hiking through the different factory halls.

I tenuki"d.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yeah, a very bad idea to send now the Flak tank Gepard.<br>SamSpade [3d]why?<br>SamSpade [3d]gotta support Ukraine somehow<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an ex General of German army was interviewed today and he said: He does not get this idea, because the Gepard is the most complicated tank with lots of electronics .... it takes months to train the crew to manage this system safely.<br>PepperX [7k]Seems better than helmets, and what was initially sent? Beds? Beds and 5000 helmets?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Gepard is too complicated by its electronics, so the General.<br>okiol [1k]basic stuff shouldn"t be undersestimated either<br>akinn [3k]~it is not designed for assymetric<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So Germany has some more "simple" tanks, the crews can be trained more easily and more quickly, either the Marder or the Leopard 1. So why sending now a highly compexe system ? Does not go together all this.<br>okiol [1k]maybe ukraine has told them that they have people capable of manning them, and that they"d be useful to counter whatever russia has?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have no good feeling about all the development of this war .... it feels it already escalated (from side of NATO/EU and USA).<br>okiol [1k]if i have understood things correctly it seems ukraine tell other countries what it needs and hope to receive it, other countries don"t just give random stuff<br>PepperX [7k]Well, compare the beginnings of WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Putin deserver most of the blame, right?<br>akinn [3k]~when or as this stared ukraine asked for nukes<br>PepperX [7k]He seems to be the initiator.<br>SamSpade [3d]indeed<br>okiol [1k]is there a good comparison to be made between this and ww2? i don"t think so<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the big meeting of 40 countries on US airbase Rammstein in Germany to plan what kind of weapon systems shall be delivered, that overstepped a line (from Russia perspective). I think we are now close to the beginning of WW3, sadly.<br>okiol [1k]i mean compare to like 20 other events that has taken place since ww2<br>akinn [3k]~sudeten chechya , deutschlnd croatia and ukraine also needed arms, there are certainly paralels<br>PepperX [7k]There are some interesting speeches that Putin gave, in the past, about restoring past glory.<br>akinn [3k]~finalnd..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an expert about Russia said today in an interview: For Putin, its not about the war against Ukraine or against EU/NATO. Finally its to fight USA. Russia doesnot take NATO/EU serious, seeing it as a marionet/puppet of US inerests.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]interests*<br>PepperX [7k]One parallel is that in WWII, countries that were not directly affected just stood by, did little.<br>akinn [3k]~i am glad he finally cuts some gas deliveries, and i wonder why he anounced early he would after spring<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yeah, gas delivery to Poland will be cut now<br>akinn [3k]~after winter<br>akinn [3k]~ rather<br>SamSpade [3d]it"s a war between only two countries, so far<br>SamSpade [3d]not much world war over it<br>okiol [1k]why are you glad for that, akinn?<br>PepperX [7k]US keeps sending weapons.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Russia cuts the gas and oilpipeline to Germany, then Germany"s economy will break down.<br>okiol [1k]usa and russia has supported opposing sides many times since ww2 with weapons and such<br>PepperX [7k]It is a proxy war.<br>akinn [3k]~less chance ppl will freeze next winter because everything is putins fault<br>PepperX [7k]France has, what? 75% nuclear?<br>okiol [1k]so you mean that you"re glad that he cut it late?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Not for Putin, SamSpade. Also Ukraine is only a puppet of USA, And as we see it now, indeed, its true. USA has already pumped nearby 4 billion US dollars of weapons into Ukraine in last 2 months. From Putin"s perspective, all what happened last 60 days, confirms him that he was right: East expansion of NATO will threaten Russia.<br>akinn [3k]~both tht he cut it late and that he cut some in time they cant shun the responmsability until epople freeze<br>okiol [1k]i give putin more credit than that, linuxgoo<br>SamSpade [3d]I am more worried about Russsia threatening east europe right now<br>PepperX [7k]That is the parallel with WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia was never at risk of being invaded<br>okiol [1k]even though russia is obviously just doing it to raise tensions, it"s just a generally bad thing that they use their nukes to poster so much<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think we have to expect a so called "strategical nuclear strike" by Russia, similar we have seen it with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if Putin should see, that he lost ground in Ukraine by enforcing Ukraine military by US/NATO weapons.<br>SamSpade [3d]when that happens, people will no doubt blame everyone but Russia<br>okiol [1k]i don"t think putin will deploy any nukes in a strategical manner<br>PepperX [7k]Putin does tactical nukes on Ukraine. Then what?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]blowing off the landscape one of Europe"s big cities, Amsterdam, Madrid, Berlin, Rome, London .... thats the final optoin for Putin to get what he wants.<br>okiol [1k]if this turns nuclear, it will be because of tensions rising and someone making a mistake<br>akinn [3k]~ofc he will<br>akinn [3k]~they anounced it beforehand<br>okiol [1k]tactical nuke is a bit different<br>akinn [3k]~the russian army cant win , they loose too much manpower as well<br>akinn [3k]~nato only thinks of arming up making the war worse<br>okiol [1k]they"re currently winning in the east<br>akinn [3k]~and saying putin causes the escalation<br>LinuxGooo [7k]tactical nukes have "only" a local effect. So it wont destroy whole Europe. But it would be enough to see people dying by radiation contaimnation that the world leaders say: Stop, we cant go on with that, same as Japan declared its capitulation.<br>akinn [3k]~sos there will be no meaningful negotiations before the tactical need is absolute<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia has offered again negotiations yesterday or today, I think.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But didnt get any answer yet, as so often in last 19 years<br>SamSpade [3d]I don"t think Russia wants peace<br>okiol [1k]anyone arguing that putin isn"t the one raising the tensions is probably trying on purpose to be wrong<br>akinn [3k]~that is an underrepresentation of the russian willing ness to negotiate<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I fear now, that USA misuses Europe, to get dominance over Russia, mainly to control the oil market. So it feels for me.<br>okiol [1k]i"m sorry what you"re saying makes no sense, linux<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Europe already started to make deals with USA to import energy from USA, to replace the Russian deliveries.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So Europe will become more dependent from USA in the future<br>akinn [3k]~i also think it is only about money and pressurising russians and has been that for 8 yrs<br>okiol [1k]europe isn"t some puppet of usa first of all, the euro-zone is considerably wealthier than usa. Second, russia doesn"t really have that much oil<br>SamSpade [3d]europe going electric<br>okiol [1k]they have some oil, but it"s not like russia is the key to dominating world oil...<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Okiol, related to military power EU/Nato is a puppet of USA<br>LinuxGooo [7k]that is what counts for Putin<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the threat is not the economical power of Europe or Germany ... contrary, the German-Russian busines srelationships did go very well<br>LinuxGooo [7k]its all about the military dominance, and here exist only 3 super powers in the world: Russia, USA and China.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin hates it, that USA and its military power has such a big influence in the world.<br>PepperX [7k]There is an interesting 11 part BBC podcast on Putin: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0015nfd/episodes/guide Yes, I know, it"s the BBC, but they have some interesting interviews with people that know and worked with him.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]USA had kept silent now for very long during last 2 months, Biden was very covered not to support Ukraine, but with the meeting yesterday (Tuesday) on Rammstein US Airbase in Germany it clearly shows, that US military now starts to overtake a leading role. I dont think, thats what Putin likes to see.<br>PepperX [7k]And Putin probably doesn"t like to listen to Rammstein, but maybe........<br>SamSpade [3d]more of a kraftwerk fan, maybe?<br>PepperX [7k]Some of those Rammstein songs, sound like a military march, you know?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Foreign minister Sergey lavrov spoke yesterday first time for a serious situatoin, that we are close to WW3. I think, thats not just "hot air"<br>akinn [3k]~wasnt it rather the mainstream west that objectd against rammstein?<br>SamSpade [3d]I bet he likes Labach<br>PepperX [7k]I agree, not hot air at all, a real possibility.<br>SamSpade [3d]Laibach<br>LinuxGooo [7k]as a student I worked on the airbase Ramstein.<br>akinn [3k]~did you sell hotdogs?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]we had to do the annual inventory of the big ware houses<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Ramstein offers a fully "American life" to the US soldiers there. They can buy every kind of US product, you normally get in the US supermarkets. So on Ramstein airbase are also US supermarkets, you get everything<br>LinuxGooo [7k]We had to do the inventory check of the stocks in gigantic big warehouses. Its total crazy if you see it.<br>akinn [3k]~beatbox rammstein spin off<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I had a 2nd job, I sold in a rollin bakery shop (mini truck) all kind of Americna bakery and sweeties in the living area of the US soldiers, Mostly I sold donuts :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And the kids loved a lot to buy sweeties, of course all in US dollars. Smurfs, white mice, lollipops etc. ..... was my Saturday job to drive aroundwith this bakery truck, and stop every 300 meters, ringing with a bell like Santa Clause, and see the little kids of US soldiers running to buy for some US cents their sweeties.<br>akinn [3k]~probably by the sheer symbolism eg less politically correct even..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So I got a little insight into the life of US soldier families on Ramstein. Its impressive huge.<br>akinn [3k]~but too boring to check it for real<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am worried ... dont know how to cope with my fears ... its hard to keep up daily life.

So it no more only a Russia-Ukraine conflict. It already has escalated.<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re saying that, they"ve been doing this stuff since forever<br>akinn [3k]~sort of the nato army mercenaried the ukrain<br>okiol [1k]it"s really messed up, but it"s unfortunately the reality we live in<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Lavrov clearly stated, that herewith, Russia has the right to attack also those countries, who deliver these weapons indirectly.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I must say: Russia is right with it.<br>okiol [1k]the point of such statements isn"t to explain why they"re going to attack, it"s to deter people from helping ukraine<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re not right lol<br>akinn [3k]~if the west had wanted an agreement the minsk accord had worked<br>okiol [1k]have you forgotten there is no good justification for russia invading ukraine in the first place?<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia doesn"t have a right to nuke us, linux<br>PepperX [7k]Hello fallowseed. Do you know what ORGAN2/ASLSP is?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But Lavrov is not a stupid guy, I think he already knows, that NATO and US army wont stop.

Just saying: In the past they just had some loud words, all hot air. Thats very naive that way.<br>okiol [1k]i"m not talking about ignoring, like i"ve already stated<br>okiol [1k]my problem is that you"re ignoring facts of what has already happened and is currently happening<br>okiol [1k]so it"s rather just the opposite<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin now is 69. So just by aging, he runs out of time. He needs some success to write something into Russia"s history books.<br>okiol [1k]literally in this situation as we"re speaking, the only reason russia is able to more or less fight ukraine 1v1 is that they have the nuclear threat, in this very war they have threatened aggression against countries that want to help ukraine and send stuff their way, and it has worked<br>okiol [1k]this is already happening, right now. We know this. It is not a cause for speculation<br>akinn [3k]~it is not about needing succes, but about, hopefully with full long term effects solving the situation of encrouchment on russia (and other countries like china africa pakistan india etc.)<br>akinn [3k]~if he has as much or a little more of donbass on 9th<br>akinn [3k]~that is easy t o sell as at least a partial militry succes<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But this time Russia"s military strategy fails, okiol. Its obvious, that Russia cant win this war by a non-atomic strategy. Even the 2nd attempt now of a "big offensive" already failed. All military experts say so, that Russia wont be successful. I think, Putin knows this already, so all what he has is tactical nuclear missiles to turn the game.<br>okiol [1k]that"s another topic, but you"re wrong there as well<br>akinn [3k]~talking speculation about russias motives i dont see much sanity at all<br>okiol [1k]russia is currently winning in the east<br>okiol [1k]they can"t take all of ukraine though<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I hope I am wrong .... of course I am not a military expert. I just try to bring this crazy puzzle together and hope I find the right interpretation for my own life.<br>okiol [1k]russia is still stronger than ukraine, there is no doubt of that<br>okiol [1k]right, but what military experts are you listening to?<br>D<br>Qkannone [6k]<br>PepperX [7k]<br>akinn [3k]~point is nato already announced ukrain would return to the east with an offensive at a later died<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I listen to former Gnerals (of German army), Professors at Universities who are experts about war history and war strategies etc. ....<br>okiol [1k]anyone saying russia has no chance of any military success at all is a propagandist, and is not mainly speaking as an objective arbiter of truth<br>akinn [3k]~so any progress towards peace or settlement is precluded beforehand<br>okiol [1k]they have already gotten a lot of military success<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What I understood, that after the retreat in Northern part, and re-organising Russia<br>okiol [1k]right, we can count that part as a win for ukraine, i agree there<br>okiol [1k]they were unable to do as much as they originally wanted<br>LinuxGooo [7k]... re-organisating Russia"s army for the Donbass offensive, that Russian army with its heavy atillery setup a front line of 400 kilometers. But experts say, that this huge length cant be successful. Russia already fails to deliver enough support for (fuel, munition etc. ...)<br>PepperX [7k]And then there is the bigger picture. What relationship does the USA have with DPRK? Iran?<br>akinn [3k]~europe could occupy trnasnestria, and if it were with the intention of peace explicit , perhaps even without putin would hardly mind<br>akinn [3k]~but i dont want that , because moldavia would not want that<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So this 2nd offensive didnt go so quickly as planned. This gives now Ukraine enough time to get the heavy atillery weapons (Howitz from Canada etc. ....) to fight the Russian army from long distance.<br>SamSpade [3d]would be funny if Iran and the US was secretly on the same side all along<br>PepperX [7k]Right, and then Putin will double down (increase his offensive).<br>akinn [3k]~well settle it in the sense for 15 years for sure and perhaps 30 yrs at least would mean transnistria realligns strategically with moldova<br>okiol [1k]i don"t know whether russia will manage to take all of donbas, honestly i don"t keep up enough with the details to have any opinion of that, but they are already controlling quite large parts of it<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Some experts say, that Putin has to demonstrate some success on 9th May, the big celebratoin of Russia"s "Victory Day". Putin cant have nothing in hands.<br>PepperX [7k]And millions of refugees<br>okiol [1k]controlling with a military force and it being actual russian territory long-term are two different things though, idk<br>PepperX [7k]and how many dead? A lot.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia already postponed some elections which had been planed for September, because the government fears that some "social nerviousity and anger" might have negative influence onto the election results. So this shows, that Putin is already kind of "nervious". He needs something to show to the population which at least looks like a victory.<br>PepperX [7k]Suppose Putin drops/sends tactical nuclear weapon(s) on Ukraine. So what"s going to happen?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Now all the heavy weapons are flooding Ukraine next weeks/months ... that wont make it easier for the Russian army to have some bigger success. The gunners of Ukraine atilery are very precise, as Drone footages show. They knock out lots of heavy Russian atillery these days.<br>PepperX [7k]More UN talk talk talk (or blah blah blah as you know who said)? That does a lot of good.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Putin should drop nuclear missiles, then I fear, that USA is not shy to throw a nuclear bomb onto Moscow.<br>PepperX [7k]Hmmmmmm........I don"t think so, but maybe.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What Putin can do is before using nuclear weapons, that he attacks with biological and chemical weapons to escalate the war onto a next level.<br>PepperX [7k]Send Nuke to Moscow would start the end of the world.<br>PepperX [7k]Yes, definitely. Chem, Bio.<br>akinn [3k]~at least they warend usa (and even england) about their perception of the complicity of these in arming up ukraine for 8 yrs preparing this war<br>SamSpade [3d]if Putin started using nukes then pretty much every country in the would would try to assassinate him<br>PepperX [7k]Maybe. Maybe not.<br>Khaleesi [-]i agree sam<br>akinn [3k]~he certainly trusted guterres a little more than macron<br>SamSpade [3d]you don"t get to act that batshit crazy without consequences<br>LinuxGooo [7k]All this crazyness is so absurd, and beyond my rational imagination what will happen concretely. Unluckily I am not the guy who reads the bible and visits the church to pray for help. Maybe I should start with to have less fears *laugh*<br>Khaleesi [-]i"m sure one intelligence service or another has people inside the kremlin<br>akinn [3k]~so many in the west may believe what they started saying..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yes, there is a narrative on its way in the Western world, which has a kind of automatism. Its really shocking<br>akinn [3k]~it would turn you into a saint bishop of the the coming refugee deluge without paying tariffs for anything russian to beget<br>LinuxGooo [7k]E.g. here in NL I cannot talk with people I meet about all this ...<br>akinn [3k]~maybe the english burried the gaellic hoards in crimea<br>LinuxGooo [7k]as soon I name "Ukraine conflict", I see in the eyes of the Dutch big fears, and same they "turn around" (symbolically spoken) just having the hope, that Netherlands wont be affected.<br>Khaleesi [-]i"m also sure that there are concerned members of the Russian military that would give a heads up to their counterparts in another country should Putin decide to go nuclear.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]People make themselves blind for the reality, so I noticed last 2 months<br>Khaleesi [-]my personal opinion, Russia probably hasn"t properly maintained their nuclear arsenal. I have doubts that most of it is still operational.<br>akinn [3k]~when i was a kid we wouldnt een talk about it in public<br>PepperX [7k]Angela Merkel was bitten by a dog, so when they met in Sept 2017, he brought his dog in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCDd6LUneg<br>akinn [3k]~now u cant talk anything not pro nato safely ofc even in private<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Today I talked with a woman, who is sales staff of a company which produces electric motors ... when I addressed this problem, she just said: We in Netherlands are safe, luckily. What an illusion, isnt ?<br>PepperX [7k]Oh, I"m sure that Russia has plenty of fully operational nukes. The Russians are renowned for their expertise in control theory, which is essential for missiles.<br>D<br>clydesdale [2k]<br>gogamefun1 [2k]~<br>LinuxGooo [7k]In Germany we have a very high quote of females in politics. Gosh ... how these women talk front microphones. Its like: Let us send as much as poossible lots of weapons to Ukraine, to punish Putin. There is so much hate and anger in the heads.<br>alfalfa [4k]also for corruption, which results in cardboard egg cartons where the metal was designed to be.<br>PepperX [7k]Russia just launched their Sarmat missile.

So Ukraine could not locate the Russian drones. Ukraine accused DJI to support Russian army that way.<br>PepperX [7k]China support ru? That cannot be!<br>Meepy [-]whats a dji?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]a Drone company in China<br>LinuxGooo [7k]DJI = Da-Jiang Innovations.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]world biggest drone manufacturer<br>LinuxGooo [7k]so far we talk about "consumer drones" :-)<br>Alex1888 [3k]i wonder how china has sold it to ukraine at all... not a friendly behaviour, haha :)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Many of the DJI drones came from donators in the West ....<br>PepperX [7k]DJI drones are widely re-sold by distributors, and as LGooo said, it"s a consumer drone, for recreational purposes.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]As soon DJI noticed it, that people bought complete stocks in Western shops, DJI pulled back. Saying, that their drones are not for military use.<br>PepperX [7k]And how is the drone firmware updated?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am not in this Drone business. I even dont have a drone on my own. So no idea how that is going<br>Alex1888 [3k]through the pc<br>Alex1888 [3k]by usb cable<br>PepperX [7k]Apple and Google update your phone when and as they like.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Ist just clicking the "update" button of the installed software I suppose<br>PepperX [7k]And the flash ROM image that is used to update the drone"s firmware, the image file on your PC, where does that come from?<br>Alex1888 [3k]from the manufacturer<br>PepperX [7k]Yes,<br>LinuxGooo [7k]you get the app on Google play, check "dJI Go app". after installation, you just select, what kind of drone you have, and then click the firmware update button. thats it<br>PepperX [7k]OK. Sounds totally safe.<br>Alex1888 [3k]there are special programs to load the firmware<br>LinuxGooo [7k]For computer its the "DJI Assistant 2", you get it on dji.com as download<br>PepperX [7k]There are also special programs to decompile/disassemble the firmware, but that is not for kyu level droners.......not even for lower dan level droners.<br>Alex1888 [3k]haha<br>Alex1888 [3k]yes, but its not that difficult, after all<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Today I wanted make a photo of our summer place, I had to enter the private ground of a steel company. So I asked the staff if I can go to the pier to make a photo. They said "no". So what I will do now I organize a Drone, and voila I will get my pics by a fly over on a weekend on this ground. :-)<br>Meepy [-]bad idea, asking for permission<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I had to .... the staff has seen me ... imagine, you come along with your bike, hiking through the different factory halls.

I tenuki"d.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yeah, a very bad idea to send now the Flak tank Gepard.<br>SamSpade [3d]why?<br>SamSpade [3d]gotta support Ukraine somehow<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an ex General of German army was interviewed today and he said: He does not get this idea, because the Gepard is the most complicated tank with lots of electronics .... it takes months to train the crew to manage this system safely.<br>PepperX [7k]Seems better than helmets, and what was initially sent? Beds? Beds and 5000 helmets?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Gepard is too complicated by its electronics, so the General.<br>okiol [1k]basic stuff shouldn"t be undersestimated either<br>akinn [3k]~it is not designed for assymetric<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So Germany has some more "simple" tanks, the crews can be trained more easily and more quickly, either the Marder or the Leopard 1. So why sending now a highly compexe system ? Does not go together all this.<br>okiol [1k]maybe ukraine has told them that they have people capable of manning them, and that they"d be useful to counter whatever russia has?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I have no good feeling about all the development of this war .... it feels it already escalated (from side of NATO/EU and USA).<br>okiol [1k]if i have understood things correctly it seems ukraine tell other countries what it needs and hope to receive it, other countries don"t just give random stuff<br>PepperX [7k]Well, compare the beginnings of WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Putin deserver most of the blame, right?<br>akinn [3k]~when or as this stared ukraine asked for nukes<br>PepperX [7k]He seems to be the initiator.<br>SamSpade [3d]indeed<br>okiol [1k]is there a good comparison to be made between this and ww2? i don"t think so<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the big meeting of 40 countries on US airbase Rammstein in Germany to plan what kind of weapon systems shall be delivered, that overstepped a line (from Russia perspective). I think we are now close to the beginning of WW3, sadly.<br>okiol [1k]i mean compare to like 20 other events that has taken place since ww2<br>akinn [3k]~sudeten chechya , deutschlnd croatia and ukraine also needed arms, there are certainly paralels<br>PepperX [7k]There are some interesting speeches that Putin gave, in the past, about restoring past glory.<br>akinn [3k]~finalnd..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an expert about Russia said today in an interview: For Putin, its not about the war against Ukraine or against EU/NATO. Finally its to fight USA. Russia doesnot take NATO/EU serious, seeing it as a marionet/puppet of US inerests.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]interests*<br>PepperX [7k]One parallel is that in WWII, countries that were not directly affected just stood by, did little.<br>akinn [3k]~i am glad he finally cuts some gas deliveries, and i wonder why he anounced early he would after spring<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yeah, gas delivery to Poland will be cut now<br>akinn [3k]~after winter<br>akinn [3k]~ rather<br>SamSpade [3d]it"s a war between only two countries, so far<br>SamSpade [3d]not much world war over it<br>okiol [1k]why are you glad for that, akinn?<br>PepperX [7k]US keeps sending weapons.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Russia cuts the gas and oilpipeline to Germany, then Germany"s economy will break down.<br>okiol [1k]usa and russia has supported opposing sides many times since ww2 with weapons and such<br>PepperX [7k]It is a proxy war.<br>akinn [3k]~less chance ppl will freeze next winter because everything is putins fault<br>PepperX [7k]France has, what? 75% nuclear?<br>okiol [1k]so you mean that you"re glad that he cut it late?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Not for Putin, SamSpade. Also Ukraine is only a puppet of USA, And as we see it now, indeed, its true. USA has already pumped nearby 4 billion US dollars of weapons into Ukraine in last 2 months. From Putin"s perspective, all what happened last 60 days, confirms him that he was right: East expansion of NATO will threaten Russia.<br>akinn [3k]~both tht he cut it late and that he cut some in time they cant shun the responmsability until epople freeze<br>okiol [1k]i give putin more credit than that, linuxgoo<br>SamSpade [3d]I am more worried about Russsia threatening east europe right now<br>PepperX [7k]That is the parallel with WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia was never at risk of being invaded<br>okiol [1k]even though russia is obviously just doing it to raise tensions, it"s just a generally bad thing that they use their nukes to poster so much<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think we have to expect a so called "strategical nuclear strike" by Russia, similar we have seen it with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if Putin should see, that he lost ground in Ukraine by enforcing Ukraine military by US/NATO weapons.<br>SamSpade [3d]when that happens, people will no doubt blame everyone but Russia<br>okiol [1k]i don"t think putin will deploy any nukes in a strategical manner<br>PepperX [7k]Putin does tactical nukes on Ukraine. Then what?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]blowing off the landscape one of Europe"s big cities, Amsterdam, Madrid, Berlin, Rome, London .... thats the final optoin for Putin to get what he wants.<br>okiol [1k]if this turns nuclear, it will be because of tensions rising and someone making a mistake<br>akinn [3k]~ofc he will<br>akinn [3k]~they anounced it beforehand<br>okiol [1k]tactical nuke is a bit different<br>akinn [3k]~the russian army cant win , they loose too much manpower as well<br>akinn [3k]~nato only thinks of arming up making the war worse<br>okiol [1k]they"re currently winning in the east<br>akinn [3k]~and saying putin causes the escalation<br>LinuxGooo [7k]tactical nukes have "only" a local effect. So it wont destroy whole Europe. But it would be enough to see people dying by radiation contaimnation that the world leaders say: Stop, we cant go on with that, same as Japan declared its capitulation.<br>akinn [3k]~sos there will be no meaningful negotiations before the tactical need is absolute<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia has offered again negotiations yesterday or today, I think.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But didnt get any answer yet, as so often in last 19 years<br>SamSpade [3d]I don"t think Russia wants peace<br>okiol [1k]anyone arguing that putin isn"t the one raising the tensions is probably trying on purpose to be wrong<br>akinn [3k]~that is an underrepresentation of the russian willing ness to negotiate<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I fear now, that USA misuses Europe, to get dominance over Russia, mainly to control the oil market. So it feels for me.<br>okiol [1k]i"m sorry what you"re saying makes no sense, linux<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Europe already started to make deals with USA to import energy from USA, to replace the Russian deliveries.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So Europe will become more dependent from USA in the future<br>akinn [3k]~i also think it is only about money and pressurising russians and has been that for 8 yrs<br>okiol [1k]europe isn"t some puppet of usa first of all, the euro-zone is considerably wealthier than usa. Second, russia doesn"t really have that much oil<br>SamSpade [3d]europe going electric<br>okiol [1k]they have some oil, but it"s not like russia is the key to dominating world oil...<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Okiol, related to military power EU/Nato is a puppet of USA<br>LinuxGooo [7k]that is what counts for Putin<br>LinuxGooo [7k]the threat is not the economical power of Europe or Germany ... contrary, the German-Russian busines srelationships did go very well<br>LinuxGooo [7k]its all about the military dominance, and here exist only 3 super powers in the world: Russia, USA and China.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin hates it, that USA and its military power has such a big influence in the world.<br>PepperX [7k]There is an interesting 11 part BBC podcast on Putin: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0015nfd/episodes/guide Yes, I know, it"s the BBC, but they have some interesting interviews with people that know and worked with him.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]USA had kept silent now for very long during last 2 months, Biden was very covered not to support Ukraine, but with the meeting yesterday (Tuesday) on Rammstein US Airbase in Germany it clearly shows, that US military now starts to overtake a leading role. I dont think, thats what Putin likes to see.<br>PepperX [7k]And Putin probably doesn"t like to listen to Rammstein, but maybe........<br>SamSpade [3d]more of a kraftwerk fan, maybe?<br>PepperX [7k]Some of those Rammstein songs, sound like a military march, you know?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Foreign minister Sergey lavrov spoke yesterday first time for a serious situatoin, that we are close to WW3.

So on Ramstein airbase are also US supermarkets, you get everything<br>LinuxGooo [7k]We had to do the inventory check of the stocks in gigantic big warehouses. Its total crazy if you see it.<br>akinn [3k]~beatbox rammstein spin off<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I had a 2nd job, I sold in a rollin bakery shop (mini truck) all kind of Americna bakery and sweeties in the living area of the US soldiers, Mostly I sold donuts :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And the kids loved a lot to buy sweeties, of course all in US dollars. Smurfs, white mice, lollipops etc. ..... was my Saturday job to drive aroundwith this bakery truck, and stop every 300 meters, ringing with a bell like Santa Clause, and see the little kids of US soldiers running to buy for some US cents their sweeties.<br>akinn [3k]~probably by the sheer symbolism eg less politically correct even..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So I got a little insight into the life of US soldier families on Ramstein. Its impressive huge.<br>akinn [3k]~but too boring to check it for real<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am worried ... dont know how to cope with my fears ... its hard to keep up daily life. How you deal with this madness ?<br>PepperX [7k]Me? I prepare for nuclear war, as best that I can.<br>PepperX [7k]Buy cans of beans.<br>R<br>clydesdale [2k]<br>15:00 + 5×0:30<br>LinuxGooo [7k]When I had cancer with 25, I got Xray / radiation treatment .

So it no more only a Russia-Ukraine conflict. It already has escalated.<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re saying that, they"ve been doing this stuff since forever<br>akinn [3k]~sort of the nato army mercenaried the ukrain<br>okiol [1k]it"s really messed up, but it"s unfortunately the reality we live in<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Lavrov clearly stated, that herewith, Russia has the right to attack also those countries, who deliver these weapons indirectly.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I must say: Russia is right with it.<br>okiol [1k]the point of such statements isn"t to explain why they"re going to attack, it"s to deter people from helping ukraine<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re not right lol<br>akinn [3k]~if the west had wanted an agreement the minsk accord had worked<br>okiol [1k]have you forgotten there is no good justification for russia invading ukraine in the first place?<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia doesn"t have a right to nuke us, linux<br>PepperX [7k]Hello fallowseed. Do you know what ORGAN2/ASLSP is?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But Lavrov is not a stupid guy, I think he already knows, that NATO and US army wont stop. So finally its a call to the world in a desperate situatoin saying: Pls, world ... listen, you dont give us another chance than moving on into a World-War 3<br>okiol [1k]how can you manage to be so wrong on every turn?<br>okiol [1k]it has already happened, it has already worked, and it is already currently working, for russia to say things like that as deterence<br>PepperX [7k]ORGAN2/ASLSP, the slowest and longest music piece ever, by John Cage, is being performed for 639 years in Halberstadt: https://universes.art/en/specials/john-cage-organ-project-halberstadt<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am used on my job to think in "worst case scenarios", so then I can think about how to get that worst situatoin under control. I am not a beliver like sitting in the church, and hope for God"s help. Thats very foolish in my understanding. Just pray and hope. Thats something for the hopeless people.<br>PepperX [7k]Worst case = no more donuts?<br>okiol [1k]you"re acting as if you"re completely certain in your speculations, as if they were foregone conclusions, but if you had followed the situation at all you"d know that you don"t need to speculate<br>SamSpade [3d]God got a habit of comfiting genocide<br>SamSpade [3d]he"ll probably end the world and expect us to be grateful for it<br>okiol [1k]maybe stop avoiding the information coming out of the conflict and start actually reading about it then, if you"re so much for not avoiding the problems...<br>PepperX [7k]Last tone change: 5 February 2022. They built a special organ for this piece.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Oriol, this situatoin is different. We are no more in the "Cold war era". or Europe looked away and kept silent, when Russia occupied the Crimean Peninsula. Now Europe as such is involved in a war against Russia. Not just on standby anymore.<br>okiol [1k]i am talking about this situation<br>akinn [3k]~the powers that be dont want an agreement so europe will be stuck in this mire until it escalates still further<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think, its wrong to ignore the warnings from Russia side. Just saying: In the past they just had some loud words, all hot air. Thats very naive that way.<br>okiol [1k]i"m not talking about ignoring, like i"ve already stated<br>okiol [1k]my problem is that you"re ignoring facts of what has already happened and is currently happening<br>okiol [1k]so it"s rather just the opposite<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin now is 69. So just by aging, he runs out of time. He needs some success to write something into Russia"s history books.<br>okiol [1k]literally in this situation as we"re speaking, the only reason russia is able to more or less fight ukraine 1v1 is that they have the nuclear threat, in this very war they have threatened aggression against countries that want to help ukraine and send stuff their way, and it has worked<br>okiol [1k]this is already happening, right now. We know this. It is not a cause for speculation<br>akinn [3k]~it is not about needing succes, but about, hopefully with full long term effects solving the situation of encrouchment on russia (and other countries like china africa pakistan india etc.)<br>akinn [3k]~if he has as much or a little more of donbass on 9th<br>akinn [3k]~that is easy t o sell as at least a partial militry succes<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But this time Russia"s military strategy fails, okiol. Its obvious, that Russia cant win this war by a non-atomic strategy. Even the 2nd attempt now of a "big offensive" already failed. All military experts say so, that Russia wont be successful. I think, Putin knows this already, so all what he has is tactical nuclear missiles to turn the game.<br>okiol [1k]that"s another topic, but you"re wrong there as well<br>akinn [3k]~talking speculation about russias motives i dont see much sanity at all<br>okiol [1k]russia is currently winning in the east<br>okiol [1k]they can"t take all of ukraine though<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I hope I am wrong .... of course I am not a military expert. I just try to bring this crazy puzzle together and hope I find the right interpretation for my own life.<br>okiol [1k]russia is still stronger than ukraine, there is no doubt of that<br>okiol [1k]right, but what military experts are you listening to?<br>D<br>Qkannone [6k]<br>PepperX [7k]<br>akinn [3k]~point is nato already announced ukrain would return to the east with an offensive at a later died<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I listen to former Gnerals (of German army), Professors at Universities who are experts about war history and war strategies etc. ....<br>okiol [1k]anyone saying russia has no chance of any military success at all is a propagandist, and is not mainly speaking as an objective arbiter of truth<br>akinn [3k]~so any progress towards peace or settlement is precluded beforehand<br>okiol [1k]they have already gotten a lot of military success<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What I understood, that after the retreat in Northern part, and re-organising Russia<br>okiol [1k]right, we can count that part as a win for ukraine, i agree there<br>okiol [1k]they were unable to do as much as they originally wanted<br>LinuxGooo [7k]... re-organisating Russia"s army for the Donbass offensive, that Russian army with its heavy atillery setup a front line of 400 kilometers. But experts say, that this huge length cant be successful. Russia already fails to deliver enough support for (fuel, munition etc. ...)<br>PepperX [7k]And then there is the bigger picture. What relationship does the USA have with DPRK? Iran?<br>akinn [3k]~europe could occupy trnasnestria, and if it were with the intention of peace explicit , perhaps even without putin would hardly mind<br>akinn [3k]~but i dont want that , because moldavia would not want that<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So this 2nd offensive didnt go so quickly as planned. This gives now Ukraine enough time to get the heavy atillery weapons (Howitz from Canada etc. ....) to fight the Russian army from long distance.<br>SamSpade [3d]would be funny if Iran and the US was secretly on the same side all along<br>PepperX [7k]Right, and then Putin will double down (increase his offensive).<br>akinn [3k]~well settle it in the sense for 15 years for sure and perhaps 30 yrs at least would mean transnistria realligns strategically with moldova<br>okiol [1k]i don"t know whether russia will manage to take all of donbas, honestly i don"t keep up enough with the details to have any opinion of that, but they are already controlling quite large parts of it<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Some experts say, that Putin has to demonstrate some success on 9th May, the big celebratoin of Russia"s "Victory Day". Putin cant have nothing in hands.<br>PepperX [7k]And millions of refugees<br>okiol [1k]controlling with a military force and it being actual russian territory long-term are two different things though, idk<br>PepperX [7k]and how many dead? A lot.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia already postponed some elections which had been planed for September, because the government fears that some "social nerviousity and anger" might have negative influence onto the election results. So this shows, that Putin is already kind of "nervious". He needs something to show to the population which at least looks like a victory.<br>PepperX [7k]Suppose Putin drops/sends tactical nuclear weapon(s) on Ukraine. So what"s going to happen?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Now all the heavy weapons are flooding Ukraine next weeks/months ... that wont make it easier for the Russian army to have some bigger success. The gunners of Ukraine atilery are very precise, as Drone footages show. They knock out lots of heavy Russian atillery these days.<br>PepperX [7k]More UN talk talk talk (or blah blah blah as you know who said)? That does a lot of good.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Putin should drop nuclear missiles, then I fear, that USA is not shy to throw a nuclear bomb onto Moscow.<br>PepperX [7k]Hmmmmmm........I don"t think so, but maybe.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What Putin can do is before using nuclear weapons, that he attacks with biological and chemical weapons to escalate the war onto a next level.<br>PepperX [7k]Send Nuke to Moscow would start the end of the world.<br>PepperX [7k]Yes, definitely. Chem, Bio.<br>akinn [3k]~at least they warend usa (and even england) about their perception of the complicity of these in arming up ukraine for 8 yrs preparing this war<br>SamSpade [3d]if Putin started using nukes then pretty much every country in the would would try to assassinate him<br>PepperX [7k]Maybe. Maybe not.<br>Khaleesi [-]i agree sam<br>akinn [3k]~he certainly trusted guterres a little more than macron<br>SamSpade [3d]you don"t get to act that batshit crazy without consequences<br>LinuxGooo [7k]All this crazyness is so absurd, and beyond my rational imagination what will happen concretely.

Maybe I should start with to have less fears *laugh*<br>Khaleesi [-]i"m sure one intelligence service or another has people inside the kremlin<br>akinn [3k]~so many in the west may believe what they started saying..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]yes, there is a narrative on its way in the Western world, which has a kind of automatism. Its really shocking<br>akinn [3k]~it would turn you into a saint bishop of the the coming refugee deluge without paying tariffs for anything russian to beget<br>LinuxGooo [7k]E.g. here in NL I cannot talk with people I meet about all this ...<br>akinn [3k]~maybe the english burried the gaellic hoards in crimea<br>LinuxGooo [7k]as soon I name "Ukraine conflict", I see in the eyes of the Dutch big fears, and same they "turn around" (symbolically spoken) just having the hope, that Netherlands wont be affected.<br>Khaleesi [-]i"m also sure that there are concerned members of the Russian military that would give a heads up to their counterparts in another country should Putin decide to go nuclear.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]People make themselves blind for the reality, so I noticed last 2 months<br>Khaleesi [-]my personal opinion, Russia probably hasn"t properly maintained their nuclear arsenal. I have doubts that most of it is still operational.<br>akinn [3k]~when i was a kid we wouldnt een talk about it in public<br>PepperX [7k]Angela Merkel was bitten by a dog, so when they met in Sept 2017, he brought his dog in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCDd6LUneg<br>akinn [3k]~now u cant talk anything not pro nato safely ofc even in private<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Today I talked with a woman, who is sales staff of a company which produces electric motors ... when I addressed this problem, she just said: We in Netherlands are safe, luckily. What an illusion, isnt ?<br>PepperX [7k]Oh, I"m sure that Russia has plenty of fully operational nukes. The Russians are renowned for their expertise in control theory, which is essential for missiles.<br>D<br>clydesdale [2k]<br>gogamefun1 [2k]~<br>LinuxGooo [7k]In Germany we have a very high quote of females in politics. Gosh ... how these women talk front microphones. Its like: Let us send as much as poossible lots of weapons to Ukraine, to punish Putin. There is so much hate and anger in the heads.<br>alfalfa [4k]also for corruption, which results in cardboard egg cartons where the metal was designed to be.<br>PepperX [7k]Russia just launched their Sarmat missile.

So Ukraine could not locate the Russian drones. Ukraine accused DJI to support Russian army that way.<br>PepperX [7k]China support ru?

Saying, that their drones are not for military use.<br>PepperX [7k]And how is the drone firmware updated?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am not in this Drone business. I even dont have a drone on my own.

Sounds totally safe.<br>Alex1888 [3k]there are special programs to load the firmware<br>LinuxGooo [7k]For computer its the "DJI Assistant 2", you get it on dji.com as download<br>PepperX [7k]There are also special programs to decompile/disassemble the firmware, but that is not for kyu level droners.......not even for lower dan level droners.<br>Alex1888 [3k]haha<br>Alex1888 [3k]yes, but its not that difficult, after all<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Today I wanted make a photo of our summer place, I had to enter the private ground of a steel company.

I think we are now close to the beginning of WW3, sadly.<br>okiol [1k]i mean compare to like 20 other events that has taken place since ww2<br>akinn [3k]~sudeten chechya , deutschlnd croatia and ukraine also needed arms, there are certainly paralels<br>PepperX [7k]There are some interesting speeches that Putin gave, in the past, about restoring past glory.<br>akinn [3k]~finalnd..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]an expert about Russia said today in an interview: For Putin, its not about the war against Ukraine or against EU/NATO. Finally its to fight USA.

Also Ukraine is only a puppet of USA, And as we see it now, indeed, its true. USA has already pumped nearby 4 billion US dollars of weapons into Ukraine in last 2 months. From Putin"s perspective, all what happened last 60 days, confirms him that he was right: East expansion of NATO will threaten Russia.<br>akinn [3k]~both tht he cut it late and that he cut some in time they cant shun the responmsability until epople freeze<br>okiol [1k]i give putin more credit than that, linuxgoo<br>SamSpade [3d]I am more worried about Russsia threatening east europe right now<br>PepperX [7k]That is the parallel with WWII.<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia was never at risk of being invaded<br>okiol [1k]even though russia is obviously just doing it to raise tensions, it"s just a generally bad thing that they use their nukes to poster so much<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think we have to expect a so called "strategical nuclear strike" by Russia, similar we have seen it with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if Putin should see, that he lost ground in Ukraine by enforcing Ukraine military by US/NATO weapons.<br>SamSpade [3d]when that happens, people will no doubt blame everyone but Russia<br>okiol [1k]i don"t think putin will deploy any nukes in a strategical manner<br>PepperX [7k]Putin does tactical nukes on Ukraine.

I dont think, thats what Putin likes to see.<br>PepperX [7k]And Putin probably doesn"t like to listen to Rammstein, but maybe........<br>SamSpade [3d]more of a kraftwerk fan, maybe?<br>PepperX [7k]Some of those Rammstein songs, sound like a military march, you know?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]The Foreign minister Sergey lavrov spoke yesterday first time for a serious situatoin, that we are close to WW3. I think, thats not just "hot air"<br>akinn [3k]~wasnt it rather the mainstream west that objectd against rammstein?<br>SamSpade [3d]I bet he likes Labach<br>PepperX [7k]I agree, not hot air at all, a real possibility.<br>SamSpade [3d]Laibach<br>LinuxGooo [7k]as a student I worked on the airbase Ramstein.<br>akinn [3k]~did you sell hotdogs?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]we had to do the annual inventory of the big ware houses<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Ramstein offers a fully "American life" to the US soldiers there. They can buy every kind of US product, you normally get in the US supermarkets. So on Ramstein airbase are also US supermarkets, you get everything<br>LinuxGooo [7k]We had to do the inventory check of the stocks in gigantic big warehouses. Its total crazy if you see it.<br>akinn [3k]~beatbox rammstein spin off<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I had a 2nd job, I sold in a rollin bakery shop (mini truck) all kind of Americna bakery and sweeties in the living area of the US soldiers, Mostly I sold donuts :-)<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And the kids loved a lot to buy sweeties, of course all in US dollars. Smurfs, white mice, lollipops etc. ..... was my Saturday job to drive aroundwith this bakery truck, and stop every 300 meters, ringing with a bell like Santa Clause, and see the little kids of US soldiers running to buy for some US cents their sweeties.<br>akinn [3k]~probably by the sheer symbolism eg less politically correct even..<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So I got a little insight into the life of US soldier families on Ramstein. Its impressive huge.<br>akinn [3k]~but too boring to check it for real<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I am worried ... dont know how to cope with my fears ... its hard to keep up daily life.

So it no more only a Russia-Ukraine conflict. It already has escalated.<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re saying that, they"ve been doing this stuff since forever<br>akinn [3k]~sort of the nato army mercenaried the ukrain<br>okiol [1k]it"s really messed up, but it"s unfortunately the reality we live in<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Lavrov clearly stated, that herewith, Russia has the right to attack also those countries, who deliver these weapons indirectly.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]And I must say: Russia is right with it.<br>okiol [1k]the point of such statements isn"t to explain why they"re going to attack, it"s to deter people from helping ukraine<br>okiol [1k]of course they"re not right lol<br>akinn [3k]~if the west had wanted an agreement the minsk accord had worked<br>okiol [1k]have you forgotten there is no good justification for russia invading ukraine in the first place?<br>SamSpade [3d]Russia doesn"t have a right to nuke us, linux<br>PepperX [7k]Hello fallowseed. Do you know what ORGAN2/ASLSP is?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But Lavrov is not a stupid guy, I think he already knows, that NATO and US army wont stop.

Thats something for the hopeless people.<br>PepperX [7k]Worst case = no more donuts?<br>okiol [1k]you"re acting as if you"re completely certain in your speculations, as if they were foregone conclusions, but if you had followed the situation at all you"d know that you don"t need to speculate<br>SamSpade [3d]God got a habit of comfiting genocide<br>SamSpade [3d]he"ll probably end the world and expect us to be grateful for it<br>okiol [1k]maybe stop avoiding the information coming out of the conflict and start actually reading about it then, if you"re so much for not avoiding the problems...<br>PepperX [7k]Last tone change: 5 February 2022. They built a special organ for this piece.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Oriol, this situatoin is different. We are no more in the "Cold war era". or Europe looked away and kept silent, when Russia occupied the Crimean Peninsula. Now Europe as such is involved in a war against Russia. Not just on standby anymore.<br>okiol [1k]i am talking about this situation<br>akinn [3k]~the powers that be dont want an agreement so europe will be stuck in this mire until it escalates still further<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I think, its wrong to ignore the warnings from Russia side. Just saying: In the past they just had some loud words, all hot air. Thats very naive that way.<br>okiol [1k]i"m not talking about ignoring, like i"ve already stated<br>okiol [1k]my problem is that you"re ignoring facts of what has already happened and is currently happening<br>okiol [1k]so it"s rather just the opposite<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Putin now is 69. So just by aging, he runs out of time. He needs some success to write something into Russia"s history books.<br>okiol [1k]literally in this situation as we"re speaking, the only reason russia is able to more or less fight ukraine 1v1 is that they have the nuclear threat, in this very war they have threatened aggression against countries that want to help ukraine and send stuff their way, and it has worked<br>okiol [1k]this is already happening, right now. We know this. It is not a cause for speculation<br>akinn [3k]~it is not about needing succes, but about, hopefully with full long term effects solving the situation of encrouchment on russia (and other countries like china africa pakistan india etc.)<br>akinn [3k]~if he has as much or a little more of donbass on 9th<br>akinn [3k]~that is easy t o sell as at least a partial militry succes<br>LinuxGooo [7k]But this time Russia"s military strategy fails, okiol. Its obvious, that Russia cant win this war by a non-atomic strategy. Even the 2nd attempt now of a "big offensive" already failed. All military experts say so, that Russia wont be successful. I think, Putin knows this already, so all what he has is tactical nuclear missiles to turn the game.<br>okiol [1k]that"s another topic, but you"re wrong there as well<br>akinn [3k]~talking speculation about russias motives i dont see much sanity at all<br>okiol [1k]russia is currently winning in the east<br>okiol [1k]they can"t take all of ukraine though<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I hope I am wrong .... of course I am not a military expert. I just try to bring this crazy puzzle together and hope I find the right interpretation for my own life.<br>okiol [1k]russia is still stronger than ukraine, there is no doubt of that<br>okiol [1k]right, but what military experts are you listening to?<br>D<br>Qkannone [6k]<br>PepperX [7k]<br>akinn [3k]~point is nato already announced ukrain would return to the east with an offensive at a later died<br>LinuxGooo [7k]I listen to former Gnerals (of German army), Professors at Universities who are experts about war history and war strategies etc. ....<br>okiol [1k]anyone saying russia has no chance of any military success at all is a propagandist, and is not mainly speaking as an objective arbiter of truth<br>akinn [3k]~so any progress towards peace or settlement is precluded beforehand<br>okiol [1k]they have already gotten a lot of military success<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What I understood, that after the retreat in Northern part, and re-organising Russia<br>okiol [1k]right, we can count that part as a win for ukraine, i agree there<br>okiol [1k]they were unable to do as much as they originally wanted<br>LinuxGooo [7k]... re-organisating Russia"s army for the Donbass offensive, that Russian army with its heavy atillery setup a front line of 400 kilometers. But experts say, that this huge length cant be successful. Russia already fails to deliver enough support for (fuel, munition etc. ...)<br>PepperX [7k]And then there is the bigger picture. What relationship does the USA have with DPRK? Iran?<br>akinn [3k]~europe could occupy trnasnestria, and if it were with the intention of peace explicit , perhaps even without putin would hardly mind<br>akinn [3k]~but i dont want that , because moldavia would not want that<br>LinuxGooo [7k]So this 2nd offensive didnt go so quickly as planned. This gives now Ukraine enough time to get the heavy atillery weapons (Howitz from Canada etc. ....) to fight the Russian army from long distance.<br>SamSpade [3d]would be funny if Iran and the US was secretly on the same side all along<br>PepperX [7k]Right, and then Putin will double down (increase his offensive).<br>akinn [3k]~well settle it in the sense for 15 years for sure and perhaps 30 yrs at least would mean transnistria realligns strategically with moldova<br>okiol [1k]i don"t know whether russia will manage to take all of donbas, honestly i don"t keep up enough with the details to have any opinion of that, but they are already controlling quite large parts of it<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Some experts say, that Putin has to demonstrate some success on 9th May, the big celebratoin of Russia"s "Victory Day". Putin cant have nothing in hands.<br>PepperX [7k]And millions of refugees<br>okiol [1k]controlling with a military force and it being actual russian territory long-term are two different things though, idk<br>PepperX [7k]and how many dead? A lot.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Russia already postponed some elections which had been planed for September, because the government fears that some "social nerviousity and anger" might have negative influence onto the election results. So this shows, that Putin is already kind of "nervious". He needs something to show to the population which at least looks like a victory.<br>PepperX [7k]Suppose Putin drops/sends tactical nuclear weapon(s) on Ukraine. So what"s going to happen?<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Now all the heavy weapons are flooding Ukraine next weeks/months ... that wont make it easier for the Russian army to have some bigger success. The gunners of Ukraine atilery are very precise, as Drone footages show. They knock out lots of heavy Russian atillery these days.<br>PepperX [7k]More UN talk talk talk (or blah blah blah as you know who said)? That does a lot of good.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If Putin should drop nuclear missiles, then I fear, that USA is not shy to throw a nuclear bomb onto Moscow.<br>PepperX [7k]Hmmmmmm........I don"t think so, but maybe.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]What Putin can do is before using nuclear weapons, that he attacks with biological and chemical weapons to escalate the war onto a next level.<br>PepperX [7k]Send Nuke to Moscow would start the end of the world.<br>PepperX [7k]Yes, definitely. Chem, Bio.<br>akinn [3k]~at least they warend usa (and even england) about their perception of the complicity of these in arming up ukraine for 8 yrs preparing this war<br>SamSpade [3d]if Putin started using nukes then pretty much every country in the would would try to assassinate him<br>PepperX [7k]Maybe.

It needs time to have the experience.<br>PepperX [7k]I listened to the UN yesterday, or 12hours ago. Talk talk talk. I listened to the Ru prepresentative, and what he said was so different from what most others said. But, I don"t think it matters. Only weapons matter.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]10 years being a doctor in medicine, and then for 6 years a minister of defense, and then a president of European parliament and so on... thats a joke.<br>PepperX [7k]20 - 30 years to become a master?! No! I became of ECR chat in only a few weeks!<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Such a person only has learnt one thing: Nice, diplomatic talking, but never being competent to have a real own opinion, always depending on so called "experts".<br>PepperX [7k]Oops! I mean, I became a master of ECR chat in only a few weeks.<br>akinn [3k]~wouldnt these work out the same?<br>PepperX [7k]No! It is important to use the expertise of others!!<br>PepperX [7k]Compare with the former evil emperor of the US who didn"t listen to experts.<br>akinn [3k]~we++ ot os a good thing and a show of talent, but indeed not enough to rely on with any and every decission alone<br>LinuxGooo [7k]but you need the ability to judge what experts tell you. Expert A tells you that the solutoin XY is the best, Expert B tells you that the solutoin WZ is the best. And now as minister you shall decide, if 200 billion Euro shall be spent for XY or WZ solution. Thats not possible.<br>akinn [3k]~nehow she doesnt deal with things like that but uses lots of feedback and backups so she was probably picked for her talents rather than her limitations<br>LinuxGooo [7k]You need to be competent in the field you represent as boss.<br>PepperX [7k]Generalism is a field.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]Von der Leyen got the job from the former minister of defense to modernize the German army. She completly failed with this task.<br>LinuxGooo [7k]One thing is to take then 20 million in hands just for "writing some strategy papers" by the so called experts ... the other thing is to understand what is said in such stratgegy papers.<br>akinn [3k]~and thats why they can now give away a 100 modern aa inventory<br>PepperX [7k]I thought the German army had these ultra-high tech tanks?<br>akinn [3k]~and panzerfasut 3 and 4<br>LinuxGooo [7k]If one of us would fail in a big concern, lets say Siemens or Google or AirFrance to get the job as top manager, to modernize this concern, and then fail ... the carreer would end forever. But Von der Leyen just smiles, and jumps on to the next big job as EU president. What comedy is that ?<br>PepperX [7k]i think most effective is integrated cyberwarefare with chem and bio and nuke.<br>PepperX [7k]And hi tech rifles.<br>PepperX [7k]shoulder launched missiles, and drones.<br><br>isbhal [4d]<br>Chris [3d]💤🏅<br>SamSpade [3d]🏆<br>neduddgii [2d?]💤<br>neobahamut [1k]💤<br>okiol [1k]<br>akinn [3k]~<br>Alex1888 [3k]<br>Epsilion [3k?]<br>hhkomi5k [3k]~💤<br>alfalfa [4k]<br>Grettir [4k]<br>highhand [4k]~💤<br>LinuxGooo [7k]<br>PepperX [7k]<br>vostbalsv2 [10k?]<br>dohduhdah [?]<br>hiss [-]💤<br>Khaleesi [-]<br>Meepy [-]<br>sheery [?]💤<br>sheeryjay [?]💤</td>

It"s just important to avoid too cringey and potentially harmful takes with it...<br>Kingu [-]*reminded that I was supposed to look stuff upon sufism*<br>okiol [1k]but also like maybe not everybody have to be these post-enlightenment perfectly understanding of every social issue and how it all fits together in the different relationships between people and stuff, i"m not sure<br>okiol [1k]what are you interested in wrt sufism?<br>Kingu [-]just basic stuff, when,where, what, who<br>okiol [1k]:D<br>Kingu [-]I"m trying to improve myy knowledge of the history of the Muslim world<br>Kingu [-]and seeing how it was "opposed" to integrists interpretations of Islam, I became curious about it<br>okiol [1k]i haven"t checked out the arabic branch, but this guy"s stuff is generally high quality in terms of scholarship, and i know he has a special interest in arabic philosophy, so maybe something of interest here! it"s a resource one could use, anyway https://historyofphilosophy.net<br>Kingu [-]oh yes, I remember<br>okiol [1k]i personally think the indian branch is very underwhelming for a podcast called "... without gaps", but anyway<br>okiol [1k]whatever is there should at least be good<br>Kingu [-]I"ll get the book, I think<br>Kingu [-]I already have two<br>okiol [1k]oh right, maybe you talked about buying them before<br>Kingu [-]I know we talked about this guy<br>okiol [1k]i hope he drastically expands on the indian branch tbh, it"s kind of embarrassing that he spends significantly more time on the 13th-14th century european phil than all of india"s phil<br>okiol [1k]i wonder what he"s gonna do with buddhism as well, since realistically it will grow beyond the boundaries of any single branch<br>okiol [1k]would make sense to treat it like he treated africana phil kind of, but then his branches start breaking apart :D<br>Kingu [-]I would imagine he needs help from other scholars<br>okiol [1k]yes, he did receive help from other scholars<br>Kingu [-]for those topics he isn"t as well versed in<br>Kingu [-]it"s a bit like ReligionForBreakfast on YouTube<br>dronin [?]sorry d/c<br>Kingu [-]he has expanded into Buddhism<br>dronin [?]he said something about that something in the muslim religion discourages scientific thinking, hence the "big absence" from a culture that already gave so much in the past (algebra, etc)<br>Kingu [-]mmh<br>okiol [1k]but idk, it just seems weird to me. It seems a bit like typical modern western phil approach, where they"re trying their best to be global, but it"s still from such a western perspective, and they"re trying to kind of have it both ways, and it turns into this weird combination of being very western-centric, but attempting to be global, so that it looks like western phil has produced like 20x the amount that indian phil has<br>Kingu [-]I would think he has no clus about what he is saying<br><br>DaoLin [3d]<br>SamSpade [3d]🏆<br>lot [1d]~<br>shengli [1d]<br>kangaroos [1k]💤<br>okiol [1k]<br>RoryDix [1k]<br>akinn [3k]~<br>Alex1888 [3k]💤<br>Yaruki [3k]<br>dohduhdah [?]💤<br>dronin [?]<br>hiss [-]💤<br>Khaleesi [-]<br>Kingu [-]<br>sheery [?]💤<br>sheeryjay [?]💤<br>yilapa [-]</td>

Everyone else owns nothing."<br>Darthvade2 [2k]~yep<br>akinn [3k]~that is just fantasy guys, schoolboy wisdom from the fanatic dads<br>akinn [3k]~oh well<br>Darthvade2 [2k]~sure, right<br>Darthvade2 [2k]~gotta run. carb coma. gotta sleep<br>akinn [3k]~i never met a communist that even was close to that idea<br>Darthvade2 [2k]~i have<br>Darthvade2 [2k]~ cu<br>ZaLord [7k]Gotta sleep too.<br>tomicus [?]ZaLord: THe number one rule of a communist "I own everything. Everyone else owns nothing.", that"s Putin, but he"s just a narcisstic megelomaniac, communism, well it involved into a coplex social structure, but as designed, that is not what communism is, it"s actually the exect opposite<br>akinn [3k]~apparently these "communist" have sth of their own that people want to sanction them and take the assets<br>tomicus [?]I"m amirican so, I"m not a fan of communism, but I am a student of history, and I like having facts right<br>tomicus [?]and they should do to putin what they did sadam hussain<br>akinn [3k]~hang him while hiding their faces in shame?<br>tomicus [?]yea, that works, he should be hung for the carnage he caused and is still causeing<br>akinn [3k]~ok and whom we are going to hang for fighting 8 yrs of civil war in ukraine?<br>tomicus [?]Abraham Lincoln?<br>akinn [3k]~probably a democrat that you want to hang them...<br>tomicus [?]we"ve had civil wars too<br>tomicus [?]I"m actuall a republican that leans conservative, you just don"t get sarcasm<br>akinn [3k]~ok ,you jst named the guy you dont want hanged<br>tomicus [?]now you"re getting it<br>akinn [3k]~well that is not so interesting<br>akinn [3k]~i also dont propose you hang jesus becus he is a commi<br>tomicus [?]I"m agnostic about jesus, he existed, that is fact, but the son of God, to be honest I have a problem choking that one down<br>akinn [3k]~they were discussing repiblicans , that are aganst trusts according to dv, are against anti trust laws because they might not work<br>akinn [3k]~now that is sth to be sarcastic about<br>akinn [3k]~republicans are the people that dont believes can work because they have an inred security they wont stick with them..<br>akinn [3k]~dont believe laws<br>akinn [3k]~i typed that<br>akinn [3k]~also they dont believe you can cure monkey pox<br>akinn [3k]~and that they know how to judge others<br>tomicus [?]I just heard a quick blurb aboout monkey pox, WHT is it? we blaming China for this one to?<br>akinn [3k]~oh yes and that gates is a communis. sorry to think they are insane<br>akinn [3k]~for them it all comes together in a fantastic spinning goo<br>tomicus [?]I just said IDK much about the story, it was a valid question<br>akinn [3k]~well if communists believe communsts believe they own everything.. perhaps gates is a communist lol<br>akinn [3k]~which one<br>tomicus [?]gates, bill gates?<br>tomicus [?]after I said 3 times IDK the story, stop acting like I know<br>akinn [3k]~filantrope however you spell that , maybe that is what these people mistake for communism<br>akinn [3k]~ok<br>akinn [3k]~sorry if i act like you knew anything about this hot republicanism i witnessed<br>tomicus [?]I"ve been off the grid for a bit<br>tomicus [?]sometimes you just need a break from the news, this Ukraine thing is making me sick<br>akinn [3k]~it is. i already sort of consider it dystopian<br>akinn [3k]~that helps coping i think<br>tomicus [?]afreed<br>tomicus [?]*agreed<br>tomicus [?]I love the word dystopian, the word, not the meaning, it just sums the situation up sucsinctly<br>akinn [3k]~but that is not a reason to see ppl drive gullible people like this zalord more crazy<br>akinn [3k]~putin isnt really a nationalist but he embraced it to rebuld russia, now he cant turnback and has to keep up that part of the narrative<br>akinn [3k]~i am not saying he is right or i am<br>akinn [3k]~just maybe it helps to understand the situation better<br>tomicus [?]he was trying to build a name for himself in history, and it worked, but I don"t think it"s the name he wanted, he was going for "the man that rebuilt russia", instaind he"s stuck with "the man who imitaded hitler and commited genocide", epic fail<br>akinn [3k]~he won i think. or at least not in some 100s of years from an objective perspective<br>akinn [3k]~you guys act as if it is about putin<br>tomicus [?]it IS about putin<br>akinn [3k]~it is not ofcourse, it is about low pensions expensive housing, huge profits on energy stuf like that<br>akinn [3k]~no next are khadaffi or china or anyone<br>tomicus [?]akinn, he"s trying to do a land grab and the Ukrainias obviouly want no part of it<br>akinn [3k]~<putin is just one pawn on the board to be eliminated<br>akinn [3k]~ukraine did not want to negotiate because they took these eastern teritories<br>tomicus [?]I won"t disagree with that, but he"s the head of the snake<br>akinn [3k]~now they dont easily have them<br>akinn [3k]~the other has<br>akinn [3k]~and it is not good enough a solution?<br>akinn [3k]~that argument wont end this war<br>akinn [3k]~if might is right for one it is for the other<br>tomicus [?]I don"t claim to have the answers that will end this war, I don"t think anybody wins<br>akinn [3k]~its easy enough and been that to stop it<br>akinn [3k]~even at a point some 2 years ago the ukrainians no longer wanted it<br>tomicus [?]the whole mig thing was a joke, on so many levels, did you follow that?<br>akinn [3k]~if it was a greatthing i p¨robably read some on it<br>akinn [3k]~do you mean the airplanees? mig?<br>tomicus [?]yes, fighter aircraft<br>akinn [3k]~not so precisely that i immediatly know what you hink of as a joke. russian electronic warfare is behind on nato<br>akinn [3k]~with similar electric gear as i understood it migs would outclass f15 s etc<br>tomicus [?]I forgot who wanted to give them away, but they wanted to give away old migs if the US would replace them with new F-16, but no country wanted to fly them in to deliver them, because that would have sucked that country into the conflict, and I"m not sure we wanted to give away new F-16, those things aint cheap<br>akinn [3k]~ah that<br>akinn [3k]~escalating stopgap measure. dunn there was sth similar<br>akinn [3k]~oh yes yesterday czech would start delivering old su tanks in exchange for new german<br>tomicus [?]LOL<br>akinn [3k]~well sorry to day , i dont think the tanks will help so much<br>akinn [3k]~but i will be more happy with the new ones in czech<br>akinn [3k]~than in ukraine<br>tomicus [?]that"s just war profiterring, it"s I laugh, but it"s sad<br>akinn [3k]~no thatis how it works in europe<br>akinn [3k]~we have to build up some force now for if it escalated and there are still many old su tanks<br>akinn [3k]~europe is small, i dont fear the russians much myself, but they do have force and numers<br>akinn [3k]~to drive to tjechia doesnt take a day in an armoured carrier<br>tomicus [?]it is a big ass country, I"ll give you that<br>akinn [3k]~ukraine is not winning , they are not loosing badly, just not winning<br>akinn [3k]~if i want to defend dneprodonetsk or whatever name<br>akinn [3k]~well our maps show the russians 200 km away<br>akinn [3k]~but they are within range<br>tomicus [?]as you pointed out, they don"t have the numbers, they have civilians fighting in the streets<br>akinn [3k]~i dont want it but ppl have operational freedom<br>akinn [3k]~maybe it is that incredibly strategic<br>akinn [3k]~i prefer guerilla to the west of it to stop the russians and no provocations<br>tomicus [?]they don"t have a lot of things russia has, it"s still a superpower, it"s hard to take one of those on, I"m surprised they are doing as well as they are, I"m rooting for them, but we"ll see what happens<br>akinn [3k]~the last drive on kiev from the east was halted<br>akinn [3k]~there is nothing good to get at the moment in donetsk or lugansk<br>Animation [3k]i heard Vangelis passed rip<br>akinn [3k]~rip<br>Animation [3k]a composer of some great albums<br>akinn [3k]~i know<br>akinn [3k]~the guy that with one or two more brough synthesizer music mainstrem<br>akinn [3k]~even a bit of a precursor of hip hop that way<br>Animation [3k]i have four of his albums in flac format<br>tomicus [?]the other interesting thing is sweednen and finland suddenly want into NATO, because they might be next, and I don"t have all the details, but IMHO, I would let the ukraine into NATO<br>akinn [3k]~do you know i think the name is tomita, anim?<br>Animation [3k]nope<br>akinn [3k]~that is a synthesizer player from he same era, i liked it still a bit better<br>akinn [3k]~dont remember why tho<br>Animation [3k]cool i"ll look him up<br>tomicus [?]now I need a "the who" song<br>Animation [3k]i"m trying to practice squatting more often cause it seems to stabilize my emotions and center my energies<br>akinn [3k]~for me nato does not have the effect of a security guarantee<br>Animation [3k]that"s of vital importance in today"s chaotic world<br>akinn [3k]~i dont in the least object tho when what is left of ukraine when the negotiations close, in time they would need to, immediatly join eu otoh<br>tomicus [?]"the who, who are you, youtube" I hoestly thought google was going to choke on that, it nailed it<br>akinn [3k]~or that would be quasi immediatly i suppose, because of some requirements, none of them very economic i figure after this ends<br>Animation [3k]Russia cannot defeat Ukraine, at best they could win a battle like at Mariupol<br>Animation [3k]now it"s time to get out<br>akinn [3k]~it is a bit of an awkward moment to considerm but from an eu security perspective the future is brighter when there isnt that bait for the conservatives in the form of a wedge into russia<br>akinn [3k]~and that translates to no ethnic war on russians<br>akinn [3k]~just a pity had we shaped up 8 yrs ago russia might have bee in eu and nato already<br>akinn [3k]~now i wonder if the opporyunity is lost forever<br>tomicus [?]"won"t be fooled again", I must have youtube on autoplay<br>akinn [3k]~sweden and finland always strongly leaned pro nato<br>akinn [3k]~the challenge is to unify what is not, not to polarise what is<br>akinn [3k]~not that i so much mind them joining nato<br>tomicus [?]I have no problem with the EU, I just want us all to be friends<br>akinn [3k]~tomi if eu didnt want to be friends it would have looked a lot differently for over 25 yrs<br>akinn [3k]~i just dont like to prepare wars<br>akinn [3k]~because of what they get to<br>akinn [3k]~and because i btw dont think usa or china or russia are anymore beyond salvation than the any of them apart<br>tomicus [?]well, I know that, I"m just saying if the ukraine winds up as part of the EU, I have no problem with that, it"s russia and china that are out of control<br>akinn [3k]~i wish it wasnt such a bg thing in ukraine eu<br>akinn [3k]~but it was<br>akinn [3k]~out of control by whom?<br>tomicus [?]well, because of what putin decided to do, that"s why we prepare, because it is insanity<br>akinn [3k]~usa is not better than russia<br>akinn [3k]~for civil peace eg.<br>akinn [3k]~or for justic eand averaged living standards<br>akinn [3k]~it is only the political difference that can cause a problem<br>tomicus [?]you keep going back to living standards, what do you mean by that?<br>akinn [3k]~that if ppl are poor in usa they are worse of than when they are poor in russia<br>akinn [3k]~very much so incomparison with the total wealth<br>akinn [3k]~and it was the first time i mentioned<br>tomicus [?]sooo, they don"t have libraries in russia?<br>akinn [3k]~how am i going to halt pollution in china when meanwhile they ahve to prepare for war?<br>akinn [3k]~i dont get what libraries have to do with it<br>tomicus [?]they do like their coal, I"ll give you that<br>tomicus [?]if you.re poor, educate yourself and get a better job<br>akinn [3k]~oh that easy<br>akinn [3k]~no russian economy is like ours<br>tomicus [?]YES! THAT EASY!<br>akinn [3k]~but even less jobs after deduction of expenses<br>tomicus [?]libraries are free here<br>akinn [3k]~they have more eessential jobs and less overhead<br>akinn [3k]~and it will stay that way because it is climate caused not hman choice<br>tomicus [?]so, the climate caused these problems?<br>akinn [3k]~for russia s economy yes, the climate is intrinsically connected to its shape<br>tomicus [?]from what I understand russia get"s quite cold, wouldn"t global warming be a good thing for them?<br>akinn [3k]~imagine a country like canada were 95% is outside the fertile belt<br>akinn [3k]~thats russia<br>tomicus [?]again, sarcasm, do not take me literally<br>akinn [3k]~i mean the climate as i was<br>akinn [3k]~it is the worst landclimate on earth<br>akinn [3k]~warminghits inland exosystems hard<br>akinn [3k]~ecosystems<br>akinn [3k]~always been<br><br>Zeng [3d]<br>ekww [2d]💤<br>shengli [1d]<br>houjuu [1k]🏅<br>leachy [1k]<br>akinn [3k]~<br>Nickj [3k]<br>Justin9202 [4k]🏅<br>Cirnopa [6k?]<br>dohduhdah [?]<br>Finnish8d [-]💤<br>hiss [-]<br>sheeryjay [?]💤<br>tomicus [?]</td>
