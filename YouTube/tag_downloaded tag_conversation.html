I am no fan of Andrew but what business is it of this man to publicly discuss what's in his bedroom?  These people sign a confidentiality clause before they work with the royal family which is supposed to be for life, so the fact that he is happy to breach that makes me question how honest and truthful he actually is.<br><br><br><br><br>Scaley Back<br>1 day ago<br>My line of work brought me into close contact, just about every shift, for several years with former sgt in the Royal Protection unit. He informed me he had little contact with the queen or D of E but being based at Windsor and I believe on occasions Sandringham he regularly had contact with others. He told me being around Diana was fantastic, she used to sneak down to talk to them and have a cup of tea with them and she was always up to pranks/practical jokes, she was his second favourite. His favourite was Princess Margaret as she really did not give a damn for protocol and any form of stuffiness whatsoever. They often had to go out into the park because she was out there with a group of friends drinking and she smoked and swore a lot no matter who was present. He said whenever she was there it was just fun and laughter. He found Charles to be aloof and cold. He despised Andrew but would never say why. He didn't really need to explain.<br><br>158<br>11<br><br><br><br>Wendy Gorman<br>11 hours ago<br>That would be correct. Margaret had no relationship with the Lord, and without pointing the finger, they (pretend) to show deference to silly, stuffy traditions and protocol---which are simply man's vain tradition, and avail nothing at the end of their time here on earth. John chapter3 needs to be reflected upon. Religion, e.g. the "church" of England, and all the mainstream denominations, or labels, are deceitful and a hindrance. Repentance and turning to a saving faith in the Saviour is the only way......people including privileged royalty are leaving the best decision of a lifetime TOO LATE! Tomorrow is NOT promised. God bless all who read, and I urgingly implore you to reflect.<br><br>6<br><br><br><br>serenity flies<br>10 hours ago<br> @Wendy Gorman  Well said Wendy! 'We are but a moment', I pray for my family and everyone to please accept Jesus Christ into your hearts to receive the gift of eternal life. He died on the cross to pay for our sins, so we can have a relationship with Our Father, through the Son and Holy Spirit.  Read the book of John, chapter 3, verse 16.  We need Him in our lives. God bless all who read this too! Amen 💞<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>trappistpreserves<br>8 hours ago<br> @Wendy Gorman  "Urgingly" is not a word.  And, in fact, Princess Margaret, like the Queen, was a Christian.  But I suppose she wasn't good enough for you, was she?  And we Brits like "silly stuffy traditions", so shaddup.<br><br>6<br><br><br><br>serenity flies<br>6 hours ago<br> @trappistpreserves  don't think there's such a word as 'shaddup' either!! 😊😊<br><br>5<br><br><br><br>Norma Dailey<br>2 hours ago<br> @serenity flies  you can get rid of your gloating emoji because SHADDUP is a word.

I don't think they'd even married yet. It was the best performance I'd ever seen from a British Royal. She was brilliant and utterly convincing. I thought they were very lucky to get her. The 'Grey Men' of the Royal Household tried to jam her into their agenda and wear her down, the way they did to Diana but Harry and Meghan stuck up for themselves. They hounded them out of the family, by intransigence and inflexibility. Yes, I'm sure there was racism involved as well. I think Harry ended up becoming a fighter, after what happened to his mother. He said he was shit scared the same thing would happen to his wife and it absolutely would have happened. Harry was damaged more than anyone by the death of his Mother. I think it made him more sensitive, more aware and more of a fighter for others. I hope they do well and find happiness. I find Andrew and Charles repulsive and a lot of that is on the Queen and their Father raising them badly. William's under the thumb and has become another heartless rich man. Harry's more like his Mum, I think.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>eye fishing gunk channel<br>9 hours ago<br>this man will of prob allready been paid off 2 keep sush or if he heard he was gonna do this he would of paid a million no problem so why he did this gotta b well it can not be money it must be to do the rite thing cos holding somet in my eyes is a crime in itsself its like having cctv of sum1 doing a crime<br><br><br><br><br>James Stuart<br>22 seconds ago<br> @Nancy Gallant Clough  I am going on facts that have been put to a court of law.

One such occasion was an argument at Balmoral over who was allocated which bathroom - the Queen told Andrew he wasn't having that bathroom after all and he could move his stuff right now.  He complied.<br><br>Most normal people grow out of that behaviour by the end of their teenage years.  He looks to have had severe 'Mummy issues' and I also wonder if he has a behavioural disorder of some kind.  The other royals had the potential to be just as spoilt and cossetted but they didn't end up like he did.  Some of his alleged behaviour is just irrational and totally abnormal, for example there was one occasion where an automatic gate sensor failed at Windsor and wouldn't open for him when he drove up.  Instead of driving a quarter mile to the next one and reporting the matter later like a normal person, he just rams the gate and totally destroys it, damaging his car in the process.<br><br>That is literally insane.
