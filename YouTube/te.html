Ted Cruz (R-TX) abruptly walked off from a British journalist’s questions about gun violence in America two days after an elementary school massacre in his state left 19 children and two adults dead.<br><br>Cruz, who is due to appear at a National Rifle Association convention this weekend, became incensed when pressed on gun laws and why mass shootings “only happen in America.”<br><br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Cruz was attending a vigil for the victims of the Robb Elementary School shooting when he was grilled by Sky News reporter Mark Stone about overhauling gun laws in the U.S. The senator began by dismissing calls for reform by saying “It’s easy to go to politics.” He added: “The proposals the Democrats have? None of them would have stopped this.” (Cruz had earlier called to “harden schools” by fitting in new bulletproof glass and only having “one door into and out of the school” during a Fox News interview.)<br><br>But when Stone asked why there was an “American exceptionalism” when it comes to mass shootings, Cruz decided to wrap things up in a hurry. “I’m sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful,” he said, patting the reporter on the chest, adding: “You know what? You’ve got your political agenda, God love you,” before walking away from the TV crew.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Stone went after Cruz, saying he “can’t answer” why mass shootings are a uniquely American problem. Visibly angry, Cruz replied: “Why is it that people come from all over the world to America? ‘Cause it’s the freest, most prosperous, safest country on earth. Stop being a propagandist,” before heading for the exit once again.<br><br><br>Advertisement<br>‘He Came in and Shot Her’: What a 4th-Grader Saw in Uvalde<br>SOUL-CRUSHING<br>Allison Quinn<br><br>Cruz was at the vigil alongside Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who is also still set to appear at the NRA’s annual meeting in Houston this week. The pair have faced calls to withdraw from the event—which will also host former President Donald Trump—including from Abbott’s gubernatorial Democratic election rival Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke was thrown out of a press conference Wednesday after he heckled Abbott and Cruz for “doing nothing” to prevent school shootings. “Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday,” O’Rourke was heard saying before his ejection.

But it certainly glossed over part of it.<br><br>After 19 seasons and 20 years, Ellen DeGeneres said goodbye to her talk show with an emotional, nostalgic, decidedly rose-colored look back at Ellen’s impact and legacy.<br><br><br>Advertisement<br>Of course it was always going to be this kind of poignant celebration. And of course it was not going to acknowledge the elephant in the room, though that elephant got more unruly, more agitated, and more impossible to ignore as the episode doubled down—and tripled down, quadrupled down…basically talked nonstop—about how nice DeGeneres is and the “family atmosphere” that her show cultivated.<br><br>In the summer of 2020, a Buzzfeed investigation put into text one of Hollywood’s biggest open secrets: that TV’s patron saint of niceness, the “Be Kind” lady, was a monster to work for.<br><br>There were detailed accounts of racism, fear, and intimidation, a ruthless environment ruled with the harsh iron fist of the woman at the top. The rumor mill had churned for years about DeGeneres’ temper and unreasonable demands. Where there was smoke, there turned out to be a blazing inferno of toxic behavior. More, three executive producers were fired for sexual misconduct, prompting an investigation.<br><br>Ellen’s Strange ‘Apology’ Won’t Satisfy Anybody<br>‘BE KIND’<br>Kevin Fallon<br><br><br>Advertisement<br>DeGeneres was forced to address all of this on the show, with an apology that was surprising in that it happened—Hollywood is known more for denial, deflection, and delusion than it is for contrition—but was still unlikely to satisfy most of her critics. That is, the critics who cared. The truth was that, for 19 years, DeGeneres has been a beloved source of entertainment and inspiration for millions of people who are, blessedly and blissfully, not “extremely online” and may have been wholly unaware of any of this controversy in the first place.<br><br>It’s in that muddy space that the Ellen finale struggled to produce a squeaky-clean final episode, the kind of earnest tribute that an institution like this show is typically given without an asterisk accounting for the complicated conversations surrounding its star.<br><br>If anything, the greatest service Thursday’s episode provided was that it was a powerful reminder of how complicated those conversations are.<br><br>We take for granted what an omnipresent, major celebrity DeGeneres has become—so prominent as to, according to those allegations, morph into quite the diva. It’s easy to forget how unlikely it is that we’re even at a place of having these debates about her and her show.<br><br>Advertisement<br>“Twenty years ago when we were trying to sell this show, no one thought this would work,” she said during her opening monologue on Thursday. “Not because it was a different kind of show, but because I was different. Very few stations wanted to buy the show, and here we are 20 years later celebrating this amazing journey together.”<br><br><br>Her sitcom had been canceled after she made the decision to come out, both in real life and as her character on her series.<br><br>It’s almost trite to say that, as an out gay person, it’s impossible to quantify the impact that DeGeneres and her public-facing bravery had in building the world that I’m able to live in today, or to explain what it means that, despite what she went through after coming out, she still had the courage and tenacity to carve space in people’s hearts for acceptance.<br><br>Advertisement<br>“When we started this show, I couldn’t say ‘gay’ on the show,” she continued. “I said it at home a lot. ‘What are we having for our gay breakfast?’ Or, ‘Pass the gay salt.’ ‘Has anyone seen the gay remote?’ Things like that. I couldn’t say ‘gay.’ I couldn’t say ‘we,’ because that implied I was with someone. I sure couldn’t say ‘wife,’ and that’s because it wasn’t legal for gay people to get married. And now I say ‘wife’ all the time.”<br><br>Then the kicker: “Twenty-five years ago they canceled my sitcom because they didn’t want a lesbian to be in primetime once a week, and I said, ‘OK, then I’ll be on daytime every day. How about that?’”<br><br>That this show happened, let alone that it became such a hit, is astounding in ways that deserved a send-off like the one the finale orchestrated. And, my word, did the show do so much good during its 19 seasons. At one point during the episode, it’s revealed that $460 million had been given to charities and deserving viewers over the years.<br><br>But, again, things are complicated. We’re a culture not in the business of complicated legacies. Nuance is an extinct concept. Measuredness? Haven’t heard that word in years.<br><br>Advertisement<br>DeGeneres built a fortress on the artifice of inclusivity and kindness. What she didn’t realize is, for the rest of us whose emotional labor is baked into each brick, how painful it is to watch it fall. So it was a confusing experience to watch Thursday’s finale and see that rubble rebuilt as a shining monument to niceness and joy, exclusively.<br><br>“It wasn’t just the philanthropic aspect of it. It was the easy rapport she had with her guests. The wily, mischievous grin she would have while delivering her jokes. Yes, it is embarrassing to admit, even the dancing.”<br>There certainly was a lot of that. But there was also so much more. That “more” was never going to be addressed in a series finale, which meant watching it was always going to be somewhat perplexing.<br><br>“What a beautiful, beautiful journey we have been on together,” she said during the show. “And if this show has made you smile, if it has lifted you up when you’re in a period of some type of pain, some type of sadness, anything you’re going through, then I have done my job. Because of this platform, we have been able to change people’s lives.”<br><br>Advertisement<br>That’s not something pompous, or an egregious display of narcissism. (OK, maybe a little.) It’s true. It’s true for me, at least, and I know I’m not alone. At a specific time in my life, Ellen was exactly that. It was the thing that made me smile, that lifted me up through pain when that pain seemed like it was all I’d ever be able to feel. From 3 to 4 p.m., five days a week, the show was something bright that somehow managed to pierce through that teflon cloud of darkness.<br><br>It wasn’t just the philanthropic aspect of it. It was the easy rapport she had with her guests. The wily, mischievous grin she would have while delivering her jokes. Yes, it is embarrassing to admit, even the dancing.<br><br>Those were the obvious things. Probably bubbling somewhere subconsciously, too, was the meaningfulness of a person like DeGeneres, who had been cast off by the industry and a large swath of culture for daring to articulate who she is and ask to be accepted for it, being the one to have such a triumph with this show. And that instead of leading with bitterness, she insisted on trumpeting that kindness and that lightness. Culture, and especially TV, had become cynical and exploitative. It was almost revolutionary for there to be something—and someone—that cared about the idea of “nice.”<br><br>Her finale guests on Thursday were Jennifer Aniston, Billie Eilish, and Pink, each of whom tearfully thanked DeGeneres for that. “If I help people find their pain, you help them find their joy,” Pink said. “You are as kind as you seem.”<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>In contrast to when celebrities posted vague words of support when the Buzzfeed investigation was first published, this doesn’t necessarily seem like A-listers circling the wagons to do damage control and protect their own. (Would you believe that a very famous person might be friendly to other famous people, but not the plebeians on their payroll?) I can buy that it was a genuine attempt to center the conversation about the show ending around what actually made it special.<br><br>That doesn’t mean that DeGeneres’ harshest critics aren’t spending this evening tending to their burn wounds from their blood boiling over each time someone, DeGeneres most of all, mentioned the “family atmosphere” at the show. Ellen! We all read the article!<br><br>But the truth of the matter is that the show that ended on Thursday was the show that Ellen always was.<br><br>Advertisement<br>Sure, it engaged with the real world—especially when, like in that 2020 apology episode, the news forced it to. Its insistence that joy is a choice in the darkest of times acknowledged that the universe of Ellen wasn’t a bubble or some sort of utopia. When the credits rolled at 4 p.m., we all had to go back to face reality and shoulder our struggles.<br><br>That said, it was a show about pleasantness, to the extent that, as it went on, some accused it of mediocre blandness. The finale had pleasant celebs talking pleasantly with a host who was in a pleasant mood. A sendoff of any other kind would have been absurd, no matter how much some people might have desired the Be Kind Lady’s mea culpa.<br><br>It Turns Out That Ellen Really Sucks<br>THE DAILY BEAST’S OBSESSED<br>Kevin Fallon<br><br>The world DeGeneres is saying goodbye to is a baffling one, considering the historical context she gave in her monologue. A potential Supreme Court decision could snowball into the dissolution of LGBT rights and civil liberties. “Don’t Say Gay” laws and anti-trans bills are popping up all over the country. The whole idea of a series that aims to be a respite amid a horrifying reality certainly reverberates given recent news.<br><br>Advertisement<br>It’s surreal in some ways. It makes you question whether we still need someone like Ellen, who was a trailblazer, or wonder who might be the person who’s next to carry that baton—and what that vehicle, if not a daytime talk show, may be.<br><br>DeGeneres did dance one last time in her final episode.

Greg Abbott said Wednesday.<br><br>Ramos made good on his vow, writing minutes later that he’d “shot my grandmother.” His last message foretold of his final act of unspeakable violence: “I’m going to shoot an elementary school,” he wrote about 15 minutes before he arrived on campus.<br><br>Abbott revealed the shooter’s final posts at a press conference, saying there was “no meaningful forewarning of this crime.” (Facebook specified that they were private one-on-one messages, not public posts.)<br><br>The messages mirror texts Ramos reportedly sent to a 15-year-old female acquaintance in Germany, who then shared them with CNN, in which he indicated he erupted because he was annoyed his grandmother took issue with his phone bill.<br><br><br>via CNN<br>But Ramos legally bought two AR-style rifles just after his 18th birthday this month and appeared to grow angry and isolated after he failed to graduate high school, friends and family members said.<br><br>Although Ramos was described as “quiet” by numerous people who knew him, a young woman who worked with him at Wendy’s until March detected an aggressive streak. Several former friends said he had stopped showing up at school and was not going to graduate with the senior class this year.<br><br>“He would be very rude towards the girls sometimes, and one of the cooks, threatening them by asking, ‘Do you know who I am?’ And he would also send inappropriate texts to the ladies,” said the former co-worker, who did not want her name used.<br><br>“At the park, there’d be videos of him trying to fight people with boxing gloves. He’d take them around with him.”<br><br>Natalie B., 19, who lives a block away from Ramos’ grandma said she knew the shooter from high school. “He had anger issues. People are saying he was bullied but I didn’t see that. He was more like the bully,” she told The Daily Beast.<br><br><br>Salvador Ramos lived in this Uvalde home with his grandparents.<br><br>Jordan Vonderhaar/Getty<br>Ramos’ grandfather, Ronald Reyes, told ABC News that Ramos didn’t go to school last year and spent a lot of time alone in his room in his grandparents’ modest bungalow in Uvalde. “He didn’t talk very much,” said Reyes, who added that Ramos moved out of his mom’s home after they had “problems.”<br><br>In an interview at a local hospital where Ramos’ grandmother, Celia Gonzalez, is being treated, the shooter’s mom, Adriana Reyes, told the Daily Mail she was surprised by her son’s rampage.<br><br>“My son wasn’t a violent person,” she claimed. “I had a good relationship with him. He kept to himself; he didn’t have many friends.” She said the last time they spoke was Ramos’ birthday when she gave him a card and “a Snoopy stuffed animal.”<br><br>But the mom’s live-in boyfriend, 62-year-old Juan Alvarez, told NBC News that the teen had a turbulent relationship with Reyes and left her home after a fight over the Wi-Fi. “He was kind of a weird one. I never got along with him. I never socialized with him. He doesn’t talk to nobody,” he said. “When you try to talk to him he’d just sit there and walk away.”<br><br>Ronald Reyes said his grandson celebrated his 18th birthday on May 16 with a trip to Applebee’s with his grandmother—but they had no idea he also celebrated by purchasing two AR-15-style rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition.<br><br><br>Instagram<br>On Tuesday morning, Reyes said a neighbor alerted him that Ramos, who is unlicensed, had shot his grandmother and taken his grandmother’s truck. Newsy reported that a neighbor named Eduardo said Ramos was angry that he didn’t graduate and got into an argument with his grandmother. She was screaming, “He shot me! He shot me!” the neighbor recounted to Newsy.<br><br>Ramos then crashed the truck near Robb Elementary, prompting a witness to call 911. Local police pursued him as he ran into the school wearing a tactical-style vest and carrying a rifle, Texas DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez said. He barricaded himself in a classroom and started shooting “whoever was in his way,” Olivarez said.<br><br>Ramos was unemployed and had no criminal history, Olivarez said.<br><br><br>The suspect’s truck crashed in a ditch.<br><br>Marco Bello/Reuters<br>Former friend Santos Valdez Jr. told The Washington Post that the two had been close friends until Ramos’ behavior started to “deteriorate.” He said Ramos, who was often bullied over a speech impediment that included a stutter and lisp, once cut up his own face with a knife “just for fun.” Valdez said he first said he was scratched by a cat and then admitted he had done it himself. “Then he told me the truth, that he’d cut up his face with knives over and over,” Valdez told the Post, adding that he had messaged over Instagram two hours before the massacre. Ramos didn’t open or read Valdez’s final message.<br><br>Another friend told the paper that he used to egg people’s vehicles and shoot random strangers with a BB gun from a car.<br><br>Hours before the shooting, an Instagram account that appears to have belonged to Ramos sent direct messages to a teenager in Los Angeles, telling her he wanted to share a “lil secret,” according to screenshots shared by the recipient, who said she barely knew Ramos but had been randomly tagged by him in photos of guns before.<br><br>He said he’d text the person in an hour and she’d have to respond, but she said she might not be awake. The last thing he wrote was, “Ima air out.”<br><br><br>Screenshot<br>The same Instagram account was deleted shortly after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott identified him as the shooter. It featured photos and stories of semiautomatic firearms—as well as selfies of someone who strongly resembled a photo of the killer shared by the Texas Department of Public Safety. A TikTok account with the same handle and profile picture, also taken offline on Tuesday, featured only a clip of a mobile game and the line “Kids be scared IRL.” Both accounts used the bio line TheBiggestOpp.<br><br>The Instagram account posted an image three days before the shooting of two rifles, including what appeared to be a Daniel Defense AR-15 with a high-capacity magazine.

John Whitmire said he’d been briefed by state police that Ramos legally purchased two “AR platform rifles” on May 17 and May 20, plus 375 rounds of ammunition on May 18. (Texas State Sen. Roland Gutierrez earlier told CNN that the rifles were purchased on Ramos’ birthday.) One rifle was in Ramos’ truck that crashed near the school, the other was with him.<br><br><br>Instagram<br>Former high school classmate Nadia Reyes recalled to the Post that he had posted an Instagram story showing himself screaming at his mother—who has not commented publicly—and calling her a bitch as she tried to kick him out of the house. “He posted videos on his Instagram where the cops were there,” Reyes told the Post. “He’d be screaming and talking to his mom really aggressively.”<br><br>Days before the shooting, Ramos texted an old classmate photos of a firearm and a bag of ammo, CNN reported. “He would message me here and there, and four days ago he sent me a picture of the AR he was using… and a backpack full of 5.56 rounds, probably like seven mags,” the unidentified friend said, “I was like, ‘Bro, why do you have this?’ and he was like, ‘Don’t worry about it.’”<br><br>“He proceeded to text me, ‘I look very different now. You wouldn’t recognize me,’” the friend added.<br><br>He said Ramos was sometimes bullied for his clothing or his family’s finances, and “he just, like, slowly dropped out” of school.<br><br>John Morales, who lives next door to Ramos’ paternal grandmother, told The Daily Beast that the teen used to play the first-person shooter game Call of Duty with Morales’ 15-year-old son. But he said he had not seen Ramos around the neighborhood for quite some time.<br><br>“I didn’t recognize him in the picture until I saw the name. Cause he had shorter hair, back in the day when I used to see him around here,” he said.<br><br>Nayeli, an 18-year-old who declined to give her last name, told The Daily Beast late Tuesday that she and Ramos had been students together, but she didn’t know him well. “I had a math class with him,” she said, adding, “He was pretty quiet in class.”<br><br>The Wendy’s co-worker said Ramos did not seem to socialize much outside his clique of friends—a group she described as “emo” or “alternative.”<br><br><br>A woman cries and hugs a young girl while on the phone outside the Willie de Leon Civic Center where grief counseling will be offered in Uvalde, Texas.<br><br>Allison Dinner/AFP via Getty<br>Janie Aviles, a great-grandmother who lives next door to Ramos’ paternal grandmother, said Ramos would sometimes help her clean outside her house. “But that was when he was little,” Aviles said, holding her hand at chest height. “He hasn’t done that recently.”<br><br>Aviles’ son, Gillardo Galindo, a produce packer at Cargill, told The Daily Beast that he would see Ramos approximately “every two months,” but said Ramos hadn’t been around much recently.<br><br>He said that some of his coworkers at Cargill had family affected by the shooting. “When they heard about all this, they had some cousins, you know, or family at the school. They took off when they learned the kids had been shot.”<br><br>DAILY BEAST<br>ABOUT<br>CONTACT<br>TIPS<br>JOBS<br>ADVERTISE<br>HELP<br>PRIVACY<br>CODE OF ETHICS & STANDARDS<br>DIVERSITY<br>TERMS & CONDITIONS<br>COPYRIGHT & TRADEMARK<br>SITEMAP<br>COUPONS<br>COOKIE SETTINGS<br>© 2022 The Daily Beast Company LLC<br><br></td></tr>

The Justice Department has "issued a tough new rule to stem the flow of ghost guns, which are increasingly being found at crime scenes and which hare the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals," Jean-Pierre said. The administration has also taken a zero tolerance policy for gun dealers who sell firearms illegally.
