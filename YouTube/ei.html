What few realize is that there really was a Tom Bradford, who wrote the book "Eight is Enough" about his own family. The show did a quite good job of staying true to the spirit of the book, which is very rare.<br><br>44<br><br><br><br>@WrenFaithBridger<br>2 years ago<br>I loved this show.

And I always felt sorry for Carrie.<br><br>4<br><br><br><br>@danbasta3677<br>1 year ago<br> @stacyharper7783  Yes she did at that.  The one girl that seemed somewhat tame about picking on Carroe also was in the movie Yental, produced by Barbra Strisdand, and the kid who potrayed Tommy Ross came back in the tv series The Greatest American Hero.  Also, actress Sissy Spacic potrayed John boy's girlfriend in The Walton's tv show who was on a couple episodes of the show. First time, as John boy's girlfriend, second time she ran away from Walton's Mountain after she felt spurned by John boy, got pregnant, and John boy delivered her little baby girl after she went into labor.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>@579tweetybird<br>8 months ago<br> @hughdavidvisor1769  Only about 6 months difference in age.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>@henrydiaz720<br>8 months ago<br>Well, alert the media!<br><br><br><br><br>@renzy5270<br>8 months ago<br>The gym teacher<br><br><br><br><br>@KimberlyLetsGo<br>8 months ago<br> @rogerdean5313  I recognized her too!

She had a lead role as the gym teacher in the iconic movie "Carrie" before Eight Is Enough and had already starred on Broadway starting back in the late 60's.  She did countless movies for the big and small screen and became one of Broadways most famous leading ladies of all time including, being called, " The Voice Of Broadway."   She's been nominated for Emmy awards,  Grammy awards and a song she sung for the Movie Tender Mercies which she starred in, was nominated for an Oscar not to mention several Tony nominations and a Tony win for Cats.   Countless albums and world concert tours makes Betty Buckley a pretty big name in the business and rightfully so with her remarkable talent.<br><br><br>Read more<br>3<br>4<br><br><br>Show more replies<br><br>@peterp.194<br>1 year ago<br>I ran into Susan Richardson at a Walmart in Coatesville, PA a couple of years ago.

They had an open set which meant you could walk into the studio and mix with the cast, when the red lights weren't flashing, which meant they were filming..  I had a chance to meet most of them, which was really cool.  Even got to play a short time with Adam Rich when they were doing a thing about saving water in the 1977 drought.
