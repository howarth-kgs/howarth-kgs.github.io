I'm sure it's a compromise to try to convey your intentions as closely as possible while speaking in a second language. I actually think he does a great job though. I understood perfectly everything he was saying, even if it is not as eloquent as it would be in Russian.<br><br><br><br><br>BasementBrassCompany<br>4 years ago<br>I like his explanation of modern liberalism and it's movement toward destruction.

He fashions vast systems of <br>ideas pulled from Western sources then proceeds to mis-apply his talents<br> by making dangerous philosophical Phantasms from his borrowed ideas.  <br>Truth be told he built an elaborate set of ideas in order to promote his<br> brand of thought but its clear his brand of thought preceded his use of<br> Philosophical concepts - it takes a not too studied look at his ideas <br>to see they are retro-traditionalist neo-fascist ideas cloaked with <br>philophastery of the most ornate kind.<br><br>11<br>6<br><br><br>ANDRÉ S.

This list contains some of our favorites.<br><br>Definition - "there is truth in wine"<br><br>The classy thing to say when you've had too much to drink and have just said something that is decidedly not classy, in vino veritas has been employed as a mea culpa of sorts for thousands of years. In the first century AD, Pliny the Elder referred to the "common proverb that in wine, there is truth in vino veritas."<br><br>First, Bacchus is mery, Wine moderately taken maketh men ioyfull; he is also naked; for, in vino veritas: drunkards tell all, and sometimes more then all.<br>— Abraham Fraunce, The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch, 1592<br><br>Amor Vincit Omnia<br>couple watching sunset on beach<br>Definition - "love conquers all things"<br><br>Shortly before the start of the first millennium, the Roman poet Virgil wrote "love conquers all things; let us too surrender to Love."<br><br>The phrase and the concept (in Latin and in English) caught on: a character in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, written in the late 1300s, wore a brooch engraved "Amor Vincit Omnia." A number of poets have shown themselves to be fond of working this Latin phrase into their works; amor vincit omnia may be found in the writing of W. H. Auden, John Gower, Diane Wakoski, and many others.<br><br>Amor vincit omnia, so Cato affirmeth, <br>And therefore a Frier whose fancie soone burneth, <br>Because he is mortall and made of mould, <br>He omits what he ought, and doth more than he should.<br>—William Shakespeare, The first and second part of the troublesome raigne of Iohn King of England, 1611<br><br>Carpe Diem<br>family jumping into pool<br>Definition - "enjoy the pleasures of the moment without concern for the future" (literally, "pluck the day")<br><br>During the 1st century BC, the Roman poet Horace wrote, "Seize the day; put no trust in the morrow." The notion of living for the moment crops up over centuries of poetry, including in the writings of Shakespeare, Milton and Byron. Carpe diem, in Latin form, may be found inserted into English prose as far back as the early 18th century.<br><br>Poh, prithee, Gentlemen, ye can't suppose Sir Zealwou'd so blind to his own Insterest, to neglect this Offer,—Hark'e, Knight, take my Advice, close with him at once, Carpe Diem.<br>— Mr. Sandford, The Female Fop: or, The False One Fitted, 1724<br><br>Utile Dulci<br>top 10 latin words to live by utile dulci<br>Definition - "the useful with the agreeable"<br><br>One of our lesser-known Latin expressions, utile dulci shares etymological space with a number of pleasing English words, including addulce ("to mollify"), dulcet ("luscious, melodious"), and the criminally underused dulcitude ("sweetness"). Utile dulci comes from the poet Horace, who in Ars Poetica, offered the following advice:<br><br>"He who joins the useful with the agreeable, wins every vote, by delighting and at the same time instructing the reader."<br><br>Herein is exhibited a connected Plan of Morality, free from that incoherent Jumble so remarkable in many Performances of this Kind. The Utile Dulci having been consulted throughout the Whole, Morality here appears gay and smiling, steals insensibly into our good Graces, and makes the most lasting Impression, being divested of that unpleasing Formality with which she is too often disgusted by partial and Mistaken Pedants.<br>— Jackson's Oxford Journal (Oxford, Eng.), 16 Apr. 1757<br><br>Semper Fidelis<br>top 10 latin words to live by semper fidelis<br>Definition - "always faithful"<br><br>These two words have long served as motto for families, schools, and organizations - most famously, since 1883, for the United States Marine Corps. Semper Fidelis is also the title of the USMC march, composed by John Philip Sousa.<br><br>The result of the election has, however, proved the reflecting portion of the Exonians to be worthy of their motto—Semper fidelis.<br>— The Standard (London, Eng.), 2 May 1831<br><br>Caveat Emptor<br>top 10 latin words to live by caveat emptor<br>Definition - "let the buyer beware"<br><br>In early Roman law, sales of goods were governed by caveat emptor: buyers were advised to scrutinize the goods before purchase, because sellers had few obligations. Over time, the imperative of caveat emptor has been softened by warranties, both express and implied.<br><br>Caveat has been adopted directly into English, and has a small range of meanings, including "a warning enjoining one from certain acts or practices" and "an explanation to prevent misinterpretation." Emptor has likewise been taken directly into our language, although the word is far less common than caveat; it has retained the rather narrow meaning of "buyer, purchaser."<br><br>Where Officers sold their Pay two or three times over, what Provision shall be made for the second or third Purchaser? Caveat Emptor is the common Answer, then let him have a better Bargain for the great Risque he runs, &c.<br>— Anon., The Case of those persons that have purchased soldiers arrears, the Irish transport debt, salt tallies, malt tickets, or an interest in any other deficient funds, 1698<br><br>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc<br>top 10 latin words to live by post hoc ergo propter hoc<br>Definition - "after this, therefore on account of it"<br><br>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc refers to the logical mistake of claiming that one thing caused another just because it happened first.<br><br>For example, the rooster crows and the sun rises - but to argue that the rooster's crowing causes the sun to rise would be post hoc, ergo propter hoc reasoning. It was Aristotle who laid the groundwork for classifying bad arguments based on logical errors like this one.<br><br>Mr. Cobbett's logic is the well known post hoc ergo propter hoc. In the Netherlands, the people eat much less animal food than their Pagan ancestors did two thousand years ago, but it does not follow that the Catholic religion is the cause of the change, any more than the Protestant religion is the cause of the short commons in England.<br>— The Morning Chronicle (London, Eng.), 6 Apr. 1826<br><br>Per Angusta Ad Augusta<br>top 10 latin words to live by per angusta ad augusta<br>Definition - "through difficulties to honors"<br><br>These four words have inspired students and soldiers for centuries. Alternative translations include "through trial to triumph" and "through difficulties to great things."<br><br>It was an obvious fact that right from the very start each one had made up his mind to work hard. The significance of the old motto "Per Angusta ad Augusta," I could not help feeling during the first few weeks after the recruits' entry into camp.<br>— The Digger, 1 Oct. 1918<br><br>Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice<br>top 10 latin words to live by si monumentum requiris circumspice<br>Definition - "if you seek his monument, look around"<br><br>It took 35 years to complete London's magnificent St. Paul's Cathedral. When its architect, Sir Christopher Wren, died twelve years later in 1723, he was entombed inside, under a simple slab of black marble. Wren's son placed a dedication nearby, which contains the words "Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice" ("Reader, if you seek a monument, look around you"). The phrase is generally used to describe a person's legacy - and can be taken to mean that what we leave behind (including intangible things like relationships) best represents our life.<br><br>There are others who have not fared so well in terms of having their name placed in dictionaries in ways that relate to work on old English cathedrals. Sir Edmund Beckett, the first Baron Grimthorpe, is the source of the word grimthorpe ("to remodel an ancient building without proper knowledge or care to retain its original quality and character"), after his attempted restoration of St. Albans cathedral was viewed as subpar.<br><br>Among the authors and printers whose portraits decorated these walls, no portrait of Caxton would be observed, for the simple reason that no authentic portrait had been handed down to us; the well-known momumental inscription to be found elsewhere was, therefore, most appropriate in this place, "Si Monumentum Requiris, circumspice."<br>— The Huddersfield Chronicle and West Yorkshire Advertiser, 2 Jul. 1877<br><br>Aere Perennius<br>line of bronze bells<br>Definition - "more lasting than bronze"<br><br>In the final poem in his third book of Odes, Horace boasts that his poetry will outlive any manmade monument: "Exegi monumentum aere perennius." ("I have made a monument more lasting than bronze.") Given that his words continue to be used two thousand years later, perhaps he's right.<br><br>However I, among others like myself, must submit to their controul; and that my book might wear a better Frontispiece, than a false Title Page and catching Motto, have prefixed a Representation of the Tomb elevated to the memory of the two most enlightened, most able, most liberal, most engaging, and, tout-ensemble, most worthy Monarchs that ever sat on any throne since the deluge; but had they not, as Horace observes, raised a "Monumentum ære perennius" to their memory, and which can never be effaced from the hearts of British subjects, the late tremendous fall of the Abbey might have mouldered their Marble Virtues in the obscurities of eternal night.<br>— Herbert Croft, The Wreck of Westminster Abbey, 1788<br><br>Sic Semper Tyrannis<br>image2140175111<br>Definition - "thus always to tyrants" - motto of Virginia<br><br>Sic semper tyrannis is a phrase with a somewhat problematic history. Some sources have claimed that this was spoken by Brutus as he delivered the knife blow to Julius Caesar. John Wilkes Booth is likewise said to have claimed the same utterance was made when he assassinated Abraham Lincoln. And the words have long been the state motto of Virginia, an incongruity which was much commented upon by abolitionists in the days leading up to the Civil War. But although the words may have been used in conjunction with various acts of violence over the years, this does not mean that they might not be useful; something, perhaps, for you to mutter softly under your breath on the occasion that some despised supervisor is fired from your company.<br><br>The "Sic Semper Tyrannis" of the ever-to-be-execrated Booth, uttered as he rushed from the scene of the great crime of the age conveys no greater insult to the memory of Abraham Lincoln, nor runs no more directly counter to the feelings and sentiments of his countrymen than does this utterance of the late so-called Democratic Convention.<br>— The Bedford Inquirer (Bedford, PA), 29 Sept. 1865<br><br>Veni, Vidi, Vici<br>image1686158374<br>Definition - "I came, I saw, I conquered"<br><br>One of the best known and most frequently quoted Latin expression, veni, vidi, vici may be found hundreds of times throughout the centuries used as an expression of triumph. The words are said to have been used by Caesar as he was enjoying a triumph. By the way, before triumph meant "a notable success" in English it had the meaning of "a ceremony attending the entering of Rome by a general who had won a decisive victory over a foreign enemy." A triumph was better than an ovation, which has the meaning "a ceremony attending the entering of Rome by a general who had won a victory of less importance than that for which a triumph was granted." One would not say "veni, vidi, vici" at an ovation.<br><br>For teaching the use and demonstration of all manner of Geometricall instruments, and the use of all instruments fitting for nauigation, &c. I saie, Quod nemo didicit, nemo docere potest: more peremptorie than Caesar, Veni, vidi, vici.<br>— Ralph Agas, A preparative to platting of landes and tenements for surveigh, 1596<br><br>Share<br> <br>More Words At Play<br>president biden giving speech<br>Biden: 'Tranche' of Sanctions<br>Biden announces Russia sanctions<br><br>fuel gauge indicator<br>The Merriam-Webster Word-O-Meter<br>Some interesting stats from February 2022<br><br>illustrated notebook that says everyday vs every day<br>'Everyday' vs. 'Every Day'<br>A simple trick to keep them separate<br><br>merriam webster time traveler<br>Time Traveler<br>Check out words from the year you were born and more!<br><br> <br>TRENDING NOW<br>tranche<br>Biden announces Russia sanctions<br><br>non assumpsit<br>Canadian truckers drive lookups<br><br>gazpacho<br>Taylor Greene on soup and secret police<br><br>SEE ALL<br>Love words?

I have been to see it many times. He is easily one of my top 3 favorite painters! Love this lecture so much. I once spent 7 hours in the National Gallery in London.... it was NOT enough time.<br><br>5<br><br><br>Rob Bell<br>8 months ago<br>This is wonderful - and I could listen to Letizia all day!<br><br>58<br><br><br>Karen Kirkpatrick<br>4 years ago<br>Great lecture. The National Gallery is quite fortunate to have three Caravaggio paintings. For those interested in his work and lifetime in greater detail, read Francine Prose's small book, "Caravaggio-Painter of Miracles".  The guy really tore up the streets while he lived but never really stopped painting until he died.   He was ahead of his time.  Thank you for the upload!<br><br>168<br>4<br><br><br>June Sperber<br>4 months ago<br>The National Gallery has always been a second home to me.However, I never appreciated Caravaggio so much until  I came across your lecture.Many thanks for  your inspiring words about this artist.<br><br>7<br><br><br>Bawb the Revelator<br>8 months ago<br>You surely have a great painter with a vivid life, Ms. Treves, but your enthusiam and detail makes it alive for me and for anyone as casual an admirer as I am.

This lecture is a treasure to explain it all even more profound.<br><br>22<br><br><br>Vanessa Vasani<br>1 year ago<br>Extraordinary evocation of the life and work of Caravaggio. This is an intellectual crush, by a deeply passionate and clear sighted historian. Just wonderful.<br><br>26<br><br><br>Mike James<br>4 years ago (edited)<br>Outstanding! Thank you Letizia, for the excellent and detailed lecture. Fascinating to hear about the many things that may have influenced Caravaggio's work.<br><br>47<br><br><br>StarFish<br>1 year ago<br>Im in awe of his work especially after learning that he only lived 39 years and accomplished so much in that short tumultuous time. I really appreciate the curator highlighting the overall style change in his technique through these works. To me his style seemed to progress from a brushy painterly flow to a more refined sfumato style while all the while fascinatingly balancing the light and shadows on his subjects and scenes.<br><br>10<br><br><br>Gustavo Moretto<br>1 year ago<br>Bravo! Brilliant lecture. So much in such a short time and so compact and fluid the combination of his art and life. I'm a professor: I'm jealous...<br><br>17<br><br><br>HOWYUAN LOK<br>8 months ago<br>This curator/speaker is such a wonderful presenter of an important masterpiece.

Her knowledge is truly incomparable. I must see more!<br><br>12<br><br><br>RonDell1935<br>1 year ago<br>Magnificent talk. Uplifting and positive. Dwelling on the art and not on the failures of his personal life. Very nicely done<br><br>6<br><br><br>Ingrid Llinas<br>7 months ago<br>Lighting, still life paintings and religious interpretations in sort of theatrical way, was a gesture that impacted a great deal of artists who went to study in Rome at that time. Thank you for details and great lecture on Caravaggio’s I appreciate it.<br><br>2<br><br><br>Denis Ceballos<br>11 months ago (edited)<br>The look on Salome’s face - incredible!<br>“I read a melancholy look, almost of regret and shame at what she had requested”, said Ms. Treves at 23:56<br><br>8<br><br><br>StevenRud<br>1 year ago<br>An absolutely fantastic speech!!! So profound and fluid flow of knowledge, so great!!! Loved every second of it!

Looking forward to seeing the exhibition at The National Gallery in December 2016.<br><br>49<br><br><br>RedSoxKal<br>6 years ago<br>The speaker was very informative and clear. Awesome talks and hope to see more in the future about other old masters. Please include some technical research. Like an input from the conservation department about what pigments were used and what varnish the original artist and his pupils used and what subsequent conservation methods were used. Thank you.<br><br>38<br><br><br>esquibelle<br>9 months ago (edited)<br>Thank you Ms. Treves. This lecture is absolutely awesome. I've studied Caravaggio for years & sat in churches in Rome for hours looking at his paintings & traveled to many other countries & places to see his work whenever I could afford to go see where & when  his work is displayed. I learned so much from this lecture. Absolutely magnificent research. Thank you National Gallery & Ms. Treves!<br><br>4<br><br><br>Lord Hades<br>3 years ago<br>I've always felt that Caravaggio was greatly underappreciated, ever since I first learned about him and all the madness surrounding his life. Behind all the chaos there was noting but brilliance.<br><br>23<br>2<br><br><br>Kiri Gilbert<br>2 years ago<br>Excellent presentation of interesting information! I'm thrilled to learn so much about the eccentric and capricious Caravaggio.<br><br>10<br><br><br>Patricia Thomas<br>3 years ago<br>Fabulous talk. I saw plenty of Caravaggios during my stay in Rome. Seeing his works in the flesh are life changing, hearing about his life is even more so. Thank you.<br><br>63<br><br><br>Angelo Mannino<br>2 years ago<br>Brava! A fantastic talk by a truly learned speaker. She’s a treasure.<br><br>45<br><br><br>Merrily Hart<br>1 year ago<br>Excellent discussion of Caravaggio and his painting with specific discussion of the 3  paintings viewed. Wonderful to have this during the current pandemic.<br><br>6<br><br><br>Guey-Mei HSU<br>8 months ago<br>It's the best crash course I've had.

I've always admired the work of Caravaggio but now I know so much more of his life and times. Thank you Letizia Treves.

These programmers are such a treasure for everyone whom love painting.<br><br>2<br><br><br>Photographe Demode<br>1 year ago<br>Love this one, have listened to it several times, so packed full of information.<br>Very obvious after looking at works by Antiveduto Grammatica that this artist had a big impact on Caravaggio.<br><br>3<br><br><br>Santiago Fernández<br>2 years ago<br>Amazing video. It's incredible to learn about art from people that really knows about it and have a lot of passion for it.<br><br>18<br><br><br>Vincent<br>2 years ago<br>I love her accent, the way she talks about name or place in Italy suddenly she changed her accent into Italian.<br><br>Great curator National Gallery has!<br><br>51<br>9<br><br><br>Caravaggio: His life and style in three paintings | National Gallery<br>1.3M views · 6 years ago<br><br>The National Gallery<br>223K subscribers<br><br>Comments • 885<br><br>Get a Free Consult Today<br>AD<br>mycloudforest.com<br><br>Up next<br>29:33<br>Vincent van Gogh: The colour and vitality of his works | National Gallery<br>The National Gallery•1M views<br><br>5:45<br>Gravitas: New chapter in India-Europe ties?<br>WION<br>New<br>37K views<br><br>38:23<br>Holbein's extraordinary 'Ambassadors' | National Gallery<br>The National Gallery•343K views<br><br>9:16<br>12 Most Famous Paintings of all Time<br>touropia•1M views<br><br>4:36<br>Gravitas: Indian authorities seize Xiaomi assets worth $725 million<br>WION<br>New<br>21K views<br><br>3:21<br>Gravitas: Germany files a case against Italy at ICJ<br>WION<br>New<br>18K views<br><br>15:51<br>Caravaggio's Taking of Christ: Great Art Explained<br>Great Art Explained•380K views<br><br>1:26:22<br>Van Gogh and After<br>Museum of Fine Arts, Boston•397K views<br><br>7:37<br>Rembrandt's portrait of his wife Saskia goes on tour | National Gallery<br>The National Gallery•55K views<br><br>10:46<br>How Botticelli revolutionised portraits | Art history in 10 minutes | National Gallery<br>The National Gallery•312K views<br><br>5:46<br>Gravitas: In Europe, PM Modi warns about the perils of war<br>WION<br>New<br>38K views<br><br>28:09<br>Rembrandt: The power of his self portraits | National Gallery<br>The National Gallery•422K views<br><br><BR>https://youtu.be/1KcdgFxmnb4</td></tr>

The one girl that seemed somewhat tame about picking on Carroe also was in the movie Yental, produced by Barbra Strisdand, and the kid who potrayed Tommy Ross came back in the tv series The Greatest American Hero.

She had a lead role as the gym teacher in the iconic movie "Carrie" before Eight Is Enough and had already starred on Broadway starting back in the late 60's.  She did countless movies for the big and small screen and became one of Broadways most famous leading ladies of all time including, being called, " The Voice Of Broadway."   She's been nominated for Emmy awards,  Grammy awards and a song she sung for the Movie Tender Mercies which she starred in, was nominated for an Oscar not to mention several Tony nominations and a Tony win for Cats.   Countless albums and world concert tours makes Betty Buckley a pretty big name in the business and rightfully so with her remarkable talent.<br><br><br>Read more<br>3<br>4<br><br><br>Show more replies<br><br>@peterp.194<br>1 year ago<br>I ran into Susan Richardson at a Walmart in Coatesville, PA a couple of years ago.

They had an open set which meant you could walk into the studio and mix with the cast, when the red lights weren't flashing, which meant they were filming..  I had a chance to meet most of them, which was really cool.  Even got to play a short time with Adam Rich when they were doing a thing about saving water in the 1977 drought.

The older he got, the more his absurdism turned to nihilism, the fewer jokes he was making, the more he was just making statements of fact.<br><br>193<br>24<br><br><br><br>@Hirnlego999<br>3 years ago<br>If you read his last book he says that he was often attacked for making fun of small things, that he brought nothing new to the table. This made him move closer to big ideas, more timeless things... he also found it funny to bring up ideas which people do not want to think about, this is why he talked quite a bit about uncomfortable topics.. you might not laugh the first time you see it as much as regular comedy, but many keep coming back to it, and that's why Carlin is part of pretty much any list of influential comedians.<br><br>49<br><br><br><br>@CaveSoundMeister<br>2 years ago<br> @Hirnlego999  there's nothing more timeless than the absurdity of regular life<br><br>23<br><br><br><br>@leahsahaas5855<br>2 years ago<br>I like the "Hippie,dippy weatherman!<br><br>6<br><br><br><br>@SPNKr16<br>2 years ago<br> @CaveSoundMeister  Yep. The older Carlin became, the less comedy and funny he was doing. It went to the point of nearly no comedy. How is that for "comedian"? And how come nobody drew the line in what was a true comedian's job? To keep you laughing and happy while they're up on the stage. Talking "truths" is not funny. If it is, it's to brush off the fear one perceives from such truth. Doesn't make it "comedy" or "humour" though.<br>Agreed, absurdity of regular life and unnoticed observations are timeless and define stand-up comedy (especially when all-ages audiences are considered). The next defining topic is vague sexual references, like what came out of Vaudeville and actors like Laurel & Hardy. Not directly talking about people fucking but being risky and enough to get a child in trouble for spinning such a thing on the turntable. Times have changed so much and we forget what real comedy is.<br><br>4<br><br><br><br>@sobreaver<br>2 years ago<br> @SPNKr16  I think the older he was getting, the more he wanted to make his work 'relevant' in the sens that he cared less and less about pleasing the crowd (his career established somehow, he was less fighting to be on the stage and more fighting for what we were left with once he's off the stage) and more and more about making the audience think, not just dozing them off with some laugh. Despite his imperfectness, I think he was trying to make the world a better place in his own way and what I remember Goerge for is this, when fooled, would you know if you have been folled ?<br><br>9<br><br><br><br>@SPNKr16<br>2 years ago<br> @sobreaver  Honestly I wouldn't have it any other way, mainly because it's the past and he died 12 years ago. I think people need to understand and realise what "truths" George eventually tried to speak out with were not "comedy" as much as humorous to a degree, at best. When people show me "the best" George Carlin bits it's almost always his very late output within 15 years of the end of his life. Yes, almost every word he spoke on stage is fantastic and great but his "angry" stuff is best viewed when in an angry phase. That's how I most enjoy that stuff.<br><br>It's like with Metallica's St. Anger. It's best listened to when in a depressed, hopeless and/or angry phase. Why? It's the most understood when you feel like that and you watch and listen to such forms of art. That's why certain people don't "get" certain things because they missed out on a certain emotion inside of them that brings out understanding they didn't know they had when they weren't "emotional".<br><br><br>Read more<br>4<br><br><br><br>@SPNKr16<br>2 years ago<br> @sobreaver  Cheers mate. Top stuff.<br><br><br><br><br>@ivrichayimthroughthetalmid855<br>1 year ago<br> @Hirnlego999  I think he just found out about the cult in control and realized society is programmed to be docile and they wouldn't be stopped.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>@ivrichayimthroughthetalmid855<br>1 year ago<br> @SPNKr16  He became a philosopher. He learned enough about the owners, aka the bankers, operate. He wasn't really trying to be funny anymore. He was literally just telling people the truth the only way he knew how.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>@SPNKr16<br>1 year ago<br> @ivrichayimthroughthetalmid855  I said that above. Also in order to write stuff like this and to go back to my St. Anger example you have to be in a negative mental state in the first place. That's why the optimal understanding you can reach while observing/consuming such information is gained by being in a similar state that the writers/authors were when they wrote that material. This is one crucial way to understand any art form that is beyond one's mental/psychological or philosophical state of mind. Even so, not all art is meant to be fully comprehended.<br><br><br><br>Show more replies<br><br><br>@felixmadison5736<br>6 years ago<br>George Carlin was a great observer of the American way of life.

Former US grand strategist Zbignew Brzezinski said: “It is IMPERATIVE that no Eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of also challenging America”. Because the US has just 4% of the world’s population, and it’s isolated from the Eurasia continent which has 70% of the world’s population, or 87% with Africa included. Defensively, it’s an advantage to the US, but economically, it’s a handicap. That’s why economically, Eurasia is a competitor to the US and the Euro is a threat to the dollar. <br>How does the US with an isolated and just 4% of world’s population maintain its position as the world’s biggest economy? The dollar must stay as the world’s reserve currency. This allows the size of the US economy to be highly scaled up, instead of being sized according to the fundamentals.<br><br>To be the world’s reserve currency, the dollar must be circulated in the world. The US created a huge consumption-based economy and shifted manufacturing outside, so that dollars flow out of the US to product suppliers like China or Japan. To make products, China and Japan need energy. The US created the Petrol-dollar scheme, so that dollar is circulated to Saudi. With the US stock and financial market much more lucrative than other countries, the dollars from Saudi are attracted back to the US. Money printed in the US to exchange for goods from outside eventually ends up with the Wall Streets, where the rich gets richer. And that completes the cycle of circulation of the dollars. <br><br>The American Dream attracted top talents around the world to strengthen the US’ science and technology sectors, and a technological gap is maintained between the US and other major economy like China, so that the US benefits from highly lucrative high-tech product/patent exports, while low profit manufacturing sector is outsourced to China and Vietnam. This is why world leader in 5G, Huawei, are banned in 2019.<br><br>If China or Japan bring back all the dollars and exchange to their local currencies, it inflates the local currencies, making their exports expensive. So, China and Japan use some of the dollars to buy US debts (treasury bonds). That’s why the US, a rich country, is in-debt to China which has just 1/5th of the US’ GDP per capita.<br><br>And by holding US treasury bills, China and Japan have to support the US dollar, for if the US dollar collapses, their hard earn money would become worthless. After Obama’s “Pivot to Asia” in 2011, which aimed to contain China, China introduced the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) in 2013 and diverted some of the dollars into it to reduce the risk of putting all eggs in one basket, and hoping that after these countries are developed, China would have a wider trade market. <br><br>With a huge population, if Asia and Africa develop rapidly, the share of the US’ economy shrinks, then the Euro could replace it as the world’s reserve currency. When that happens, the US would no longer be able to print money out of nothing without a hyper inflation like Venezuela. Then the size of the US economy has to fall back to the fundamentals, which today is quite a lot smaller than the inflated economy. That’s why no country in Eurasia is allowed to catch up with the US’ economy. When Japan was catching up fast on the US in the 1980s, they were knocked down to a three decade stagnancy by appreciating the Japanese Yen. And in the last 30 years, the US created conflicts, wars and color revolutions in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa to destabilise the Eurasia-Africa supercontinent. <br><br>When the US prints a lot of money, other countries’ foreign reserves in dollars shrink in value. Furthermore, to prevent exports to the US becoming expensive, these countries have to print money too, which devalues the savings of the people, and causing inflations in these countries. It’s estimated that our savings devalue by 6-9% per year after the abolishment of the gold-backed Bretton Woods system, after which the US prints money based on just the creditability of the dollar.<br><br>North America is relatively easy to defend, yet the US has a military budget more than the total of the next 9 countries in the top 10, to protect the dollar with its 800 military bases worldwide. <br><br>For the record, the US had no mercy on threats to the dollar:<br>* In 2000 Saddam Hussein said he would start selling oil in Euros not Dollars. <br>   >> Saddam was hanged by the US.<br>* In 2009 Gaddafi made Libya export oil in Gold Dinars, not in dollar or Euro. <br>   >> Gaddafi was killed by US-backed NTC.<br>* Syria had an independent Central Bank NOT under Federal Reserve controlled Bank of International Settlements. <br>   >> Obama attempted to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.<br>* Iran has been trading oil in currencies other than US dollars since 2011. <br>   >> Iran was being sanctioned by the US.<br>* After being sanctioned in 2014, Putin started to trade in non-dollar. In 2019, Putin (1) completely ditched dollars in oil trades, (2) sold almost all the US treasury bonds, (3) is now the forerunner in de-dollarization. <br>   >> The US tried to topple Putin by supporting Alexei Navalny. And now the Ukraine war to weaken Russia.<br>* China (1) introduced the BRI in 2013 which helps many countries to develop and speed up the integration of Eurasia, (2) used non-dollar in oil trades with Iran and Russia, (3) introduced the CIPS, an alternative to the West’s SWIFT system which has been weaponized by America, (4) China’s economy and high technology are catching up fast. <br>   >> China has become the US’ #1 target.<br><br>If a country supports the dollar, it’s being looted; if a country doesn’t support the dollar, the government is changed by the US. This is financial slavery.<br><br>The Fed has printed 80% of all US dollars in existence since Jan 2020. There was $4.02 trillion dollars in circulation at the beginning of 2020. The number reached $20.08 trillion by Oct 2021. This amounted to an astronomical 30 trillions debt. Coupled with a global rising urge to diversify into non-dollar reserves caused by the US’ sanctions to 39 countries, the dollar is in a creditability crisis. This is the major development which shapes geopolitics in the world today.<br><br>The US cannot have direct wars with Russia and China because they are nuclear armed. Proxy wars put the battlefields outside of the US, and the US would looked like an outsider. Remember in the 1980s, the US supported the Afghan Mujaheddin in a proxy war against the USSR. Russia and China have clearly defined their redlines. US would use its collaborators Zelensky and Tsai to push across the redlines to trigger the wars, and it would sell weapons to its allies in NATO and AUKUS, and get them to support the wars. <br><br>After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, US President Bill Clinton had two choices: (a) to integrate Russia into Europe and abolish NATO, OR, (b) to slowly alienate Russia to keep Russia and Europe divided. Clinton chose the latter, because if there’s no more Russia “threat”, there would be no more NATO to control Europe. As the first NATO Secretary General, Lionel Ismay described the military role of NATO: “To keep America IN, to keep Russia OUT, to keep Germany (Europe) DOWN”. NATO also allows the US to place missiles in Europe, so if a war break out in Europe, missiles would be flying between Moscow the East and Lisbon in the West, while the US remains safe across the Atlantic. <br><br>And politically, the EU is an American creation, as much as a European one. It’s much easier for Washington to control ruling elites at Brussels than having to control all politicians in Europe. The EU is used an ally or a sacrificial depending on the geopolitical needs of Washington.<br><br>The proxy war in Ukraine: 1.Divided Europe from Russia and divided Eurasia. 2.Killed Nord Stream II gas pipeline and German firm Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg has signed up for gas from America Venture Global LNG for 20 years. The US gained control over energy supply to Europe. 3.Created continuity for the Military Industrial Complex after pulling out of Afghanistan. 4.Most importantly, the war strengthened the dollar. Dollar against Euro is now the highest since NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia in Mar 1999 (happened two months after the official launch of Euro as the currency of the EU, which threatened the dollar). A strong dollar together with the Fed’s interest rise in 2022 cause capitals from all over the world to flow into the US’ economy, while collapsing other economies, like Sri Lanka.<br><br>Else where, two months after ignoring a warning from Washington against his visit to Moscow, highly popular Imran Khan was ousted from the PM post of Pakistan  on 9 Apr 2022. A month after ignoring Biden’s demand to increase oil production, secretary-general of OPEC, Mohammad Barkindo died unexpectedly on July 6 2022.<br><br>The US isn’t relinquishing its privilege to loot. Remember after WW II, Europe and Asia were devastated, but the US emerged as the world leader and the dollar became the world’s reserve currency.<br><br><br>Read more<br><br><br><br>@mariohelmie2965<br>2 months ago<br>Saying china while your country is the biggest nuclear build up the first on to use it and started it all....<br><br><br><br><br>@kfly5006<br>2 months ago<br>Why didn't we hear this about Palestine?<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>@ginebra7448<br>2 months ago<br>What is Proxy War?<br>Who Create Proxy War?<br><br><br><br><br>@solkalibri1376<br>1 month ago<br>Ukraine should have been a province of Russia and this war should not have happened.<br><br><br><br><br>@hoseadarrelvirry4336<br>2 months ago<br>it's country<br><br><br><br><br>@LS.....<br>2 weeks ago<br>Biden🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Unear<br><br><br><br><br>@ovauskhan8119<br>2 months ago<br>But not why not China... when China is flouncing encouraging!<br><br><br><br>@859Videos<br>2 months ago<br>Um....what's the war in the Middle East then<br><br>1<br><br><br>@user-yl6xp4jx3z<br>2 months ago<br>Been making videos and comments about how senile this guy is...

The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead and walking in the newness of life. <br>That's what Acts 2:38 is. It harmonizes with Matthew 28:19, and all the other salvation scriptures.  <br>We can't pick and choose which scriptures we like or dislike.  <br>We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOTH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT for a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter the kingdom of GOD.  <br>We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed.  One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans.  <br>Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures, and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.  Eternity is TOO long to be WRONG! St, John 5:39, search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  <br>The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.  <br>It's better to walk alone than with a crowd going in the wrong direction.  Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone.  Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS, and the other is a WORK OF FAITH or OBEDIENCE TO GOD.  <br>If I buy you a cake and tell you to come to get it, and you refuse to, then you won't have the cake even though it's been fully paid for. Christ set up the way, and we must come the way he set up to be saved or to receive it.  <br>Noah believed or had FAITH, BUT THEN WORKED OR OBEYED TO BUILD THE ARK TO BE SAVED. LOT believed or had FAITH, BUT THEN OBEYED AND LEFT SODOM. This is why Jesus said, He that believes and is baptized shall be saved. FAITH EQUALS  OBEDIENCE TO GOD! All scriptures have to harmonize together .<br><br><br><br><br>1Who C's<br>1 year ago<br>I want to make it clear..

What makes up a person? Ever hear someone say, "he has his mother's eyes" or "he has his father's hairline"? Well, that comes from something called DNA and that's what humans, and in fact nearly all life on earth is composed of. So, to be clear, you're saying "proud of something completely out of his control" as if it's untrue when everything he's referred to is 100% IN his DNA's control.<br><br>Cut the bullshit "you didn't have anything to do with that" when people refer to their ancestors and extended families/tribes.

What was more amazing and eye opening was how everyone in the chatroom thought he was some white hill billy, they started calling him white racist names, and other white trash stereotypes.

As regards blacks, there was some assimilation going on there, too, as more blacks rose into the middle class and were able to benefit from better education which was previously more difficult for them to get. Most coherent nations are more ethnically homogeneous, but the U.S. has been an experiment to see if a homogeneity of political and social ideals could outweigh ethnic heterogeneity. In large part, it has been working, and is accelerating as blacks and legally-immigrated Hispanics are turning away from the anti-American regime currently occupying the White House and holding a majority in the Congress. <br>-- Culture and race are entangled issues, difficult to disentangle. There is a lot of overlap, because of the geographical correlation between origins of cultures and races. Traditions and customs change slowly. And given the way human brains work, a lot of associations that underpin stereotypes can seem to be validated by observation, despite errors in causal reasoning. It's easy for people to move from "this group of people tends to behave in this way" to "this group of people is necessarily and genetically bound to behave in this way." <br>-- Collectivist thinking makes matters worse, and collectivism is a necessary assumption of racism. Add in some postmodernism, a philosophical approach that disclaims the possibility for objective truth, and degrades the notion of truth to either feelings or some groups propaganda, and the stage is set for third- and fourth-wave feminism, CRT, and other ideologies that fervently attach themselves to untruths and irrationality. <br>-- Few people have been able to get the education to sort out the philosophical, psychological, and ideological issues explicitly, and the leftward slide of educational institution has resulted in a couple of generations that are mostly intellectually corrupted. The wonder is that there remains some good will among races.<br><br>11<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago<br> @keiko909  aka the truth<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>Fandrie Koh<br>2 days ago<br> @billybobbananas  jokes aside, my chinese mil had a big lump removed from her jaw by a black surgeon when doctors told her that there are terrible risks of nerve damage and her face sagging ... he removed it and aside from a slight asymmetry when she smiles, her facial muscles are all intact.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago (edited)<br>blacks think they are so cool and so special and they actually think we think they are cool and special and worship them, when it is the exact opposite and we don't want to be near them and flee when they inevitably always follow us, access to whites is not a right, LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE!!! don't they claim to hate us and that we oppress them? so why do they follow us everywhere and barge in<br><br>26<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago (edited)<br> @Fandrie Koh  a black doctor here in Canada almost killed my friend by cutting his liver in half when he was supposed to work on his gall bladder or pancreas(can't remember which)..they are not as smart, skilled or dedicated as whites on the macro average, and by a huge margin, they also get affirmative action(anti-white racism) that lowers the standards and passes them when they are incompetent and inept<br><br>19<br><br><br><br>Ethan Mac<br>2 days ago<br> @grizzlygrizzle  lmfao, the hijacked west are the bully tyrant aggressor invaders not China and Russia<br><br>8<br><br><br><br>Fandrie Koh<br>2 days ago<br> @Ethan Mac  my point is, as much as we like to use stats to justify racial stereotypes and judgement of ethnic groups, those stats cannot predict an individual's ability/skills or personality because individuals vary wildly from statistical median.

The former is trying to protect cultures from those who demand that you either assimilate to their narrow version of national identity, or else you have no say in the country in which you live and pay taxes.<br><br>I would strongly question your idea that their is such thing as a monoculture in the West. I consider myself to have more in common with a working class, football supporting, progressively-voting immigrant, who maybe likes a pint and takeaway at the end of the night, than I do with some posh, Eton educated, champagne swilling, fox-murdering, millionaire Tory donor. But happy for you to define exactly what the mono-culture is that you are referring to and what it consists of.<br><br>Apart from this, the idea of a monoculture is ahistorical and ignores that ideas and knowledge pass over and between artificial borders and have done since before the origin of even Homo Sapiens.<br><br>Just some thoughts.<br><br><br><br><br>Matthew Foley<br>1 day ago<br> @ootmaster1  ethno nationalism is the definition of Fascsim. It is not ok to even entertain ideas that have lead to the biggest mass murder in History. Let alone ideas that previous generations of Brits were killed fighting against (if you are British, where fuck is your national pride?). Ethno nationalism is nothing new. It has consistently been employed to trick idiots. Those too stupid to realise that the people fucking them in the arse are not people with different skin colours, but the billionaire class and paid for politicians who are lowering our living standards and stagnating our wages.<br><br>Honestly, just grow the fuck up!<br><br><br><br><br>Matthew Foley<br>1 day ago<br> @Marc Wright  Enoch Powell was wrong. Haven't seen any rivers of blood about lately.😅<br><br><br><br><br>Matthew Foley<br>1 day ago<br> @Paying-For-Freedom  do you think breeding outside of your close family leeds to a world without uniqueness? Maybe a touch of difference is sometimes needed to make sure that uniqueness doesn't come at the expense of everyone being retarded😅.<br><br>Some people don't mind change. It's not that scary bud, honestly.<br><br><br><br><br>Matthew Foley<br>1 day ago<br> @ootmaster1  there are many reasons why you might side with the lesser of two evils to win a war. Doesn't mean you endorse the political system of that country. If we endorsed the Soviet Union, we probably wouldn't have spent 45 years in a Cold War against them.<br><br>Like the mind of a child.

Both require division; to put people in their own groups based on a factor. Everything divided is weaker than everything united.<br><br>We need to be unified.

I am no fan of Andrew but what business is it of this man to publicly discuss what's in his bedroom?  These people sign a confidentiality clause before they work with the royal family which is supposed to be for life, so the fact that he is happy to breach that makes me question how honest and truthful he actually is.<br><br><br><br><br>Scaley Back<br>1 day ago<br>My line of work brought me into close contact, just about every shift, for several years with former sgt in the Royal Protection unit. He informed me he had little contact with the queen or D of E but being based at Windsor and I believe on occasions Sandringham he regularly had contact with others. He told me being around Diana was fantastic, she used to sneak down to talk to them and have a cup of tea with them and she was always up to pranks/practical jokes, she was his second favourite. His favourite was Princess Margaret as she really did not give a damn for protocol and any form of stuffiness whatsoever. They often had to go out into the park because she was out there with a group of friends drinking and she smoked and swore a lot no matter who was present. He said whenever she was there it was just fun and laughter. He found Charles to be aloof and cold. He despised Andrew but would never say why. He didn't really need to explain.<br><br>158<br>11<br><br><br><br>Wendy Gorman<br>11 hours ago<br>That would be correct. Margaret had no relationship with the Lord, and without pointing the finger, they (pretend) to show deference to silly, stuffy traditions and protocol---which are simply man's vain tradition, and avail nothing at the end of their time here on earth. John chapter3 needs to be reflected upon. Religion, e.g. the "church" of England, and all the mainstream denominations, or labels, are deceitful and a hindrance. Repentance and turning to a saving faith in the Saviour is the only way......people including privileged royalty are leaving the best decision of a lifetime TOO LATE! Tomorrow is NOT promised. God bless all who read, and I urgingly implore you to reflect.<br><br>6<br><br><br><br>serenity flies<br>10 hours ago<br> @Wendy Gorman  Well said Wendy! 'We are but a moment', I pray for my family and everyone to please accept Jesus Christ into your hearts to receive the gift of eternal life. He died on the cross to pay for our sins, so we can have a relationship with Our Father, through the Son and Holy Spirit.  Read the book of John, chapter 3, verse 16.  We need Him in our lives. God bless all who read this too! Amen 💞<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>trappistpreserves<br>8 hours ago<br> @Wendy Gorman  "Urgingly" is not a word.  And, in fact, Princess Margaret, like the Queen, was a Christian.  But I suppose she wasn't good enough for you, was she?  And we Brits like "silly stuffy traditions", so shaddup.<br><br>6<br><br><br><br>serenity flies<br>6 hours ago<br> @trappistpreserves  don't think there's such a word as 'shaddup' either!! 😊😊<br><br>5<br><br><br><br>Norma Dailey<br>2 hours ago<br> @serenity flies  you can get rid of your gloating emoji because SHADDUP is a word.

I don't think they'd even married yet. It was the best performance I'd ever seen from a British Royal. She was brilliant and utterly convincing. I thought they were very lucky to get her. The 'Grey Men' of the Royal Household tried to jam her into their agenda and wear her down, the way they did to Diana but Harry and Meghan stuck up for themselves. They hounded them out of the family, by intransigence and inflexibility. Yes, I'm sure there was racism involved as well. I think Harry ended up becoming a fighter, after what happened to his mother. He said he was shit scared the same thing would happen to his wife and it absolutely would have happened. Harry was damaged more than anyone by the death of his Mother. I think it made him more sensitive, more aware and more of a fighter for others. I hope they do well and find happiness. I find Andrew and Charles repulsive and a lot of that is on the Queen and their Father raising them badly. William's under the thumb and has become another heartless rich man. Harry's more like his Mum, I think.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>eye fishing gunk channel<br>9 hours ago<br>this man will of prob allready been paid off 2 keep sush or if he heard he was gonna do this he would of paid a million no problem so why he did this gotta b well it can not be money it must be to do the rite thing cos holding somet in my eyes is a crime in itsself its like having cctv of sum1 doing a crime<br><br><br><br><br>James Stuart<br>22 seconds ago<br> @Nancy Gallant Clough  I am going on facts that have been put to a court of law. Saying Andrew was the Queens favourite is meaningless as it does not prove or disprove anything. <br><br>This guy actually stole money from his fellow protection officers and spent it on his pornography habit. He is now on tv telling people how awful Andrew (i am no fan of Prince Andrew) was to staff but this guy went to prison for stealing from them.

One such occasion was an argument at Balmoral over who was allocated which bathroom - the Queen told Andrew he wasn't having that bathroom after all and he could move his stuff right now.  He complied.<br><br>Most normal people grow out of that behaviour by the end of their teenage years.  He looks to have had severe 'Mummy issues' and I also wonder if he has a behavioural disorder of some kind.  The other royals had the potential to be just as spoilt and cossetted but they didn't end up like he did.  Some of his alleged behaviour is just irrational and totally abnormal, for example there was one occasion where an automatic gate sensor failed at Windsor and wouldn't open for him when he drove up.  Instead of driving a quarter mile to the next one and reporting the matter later like a normal person, he just rams the gate and totally destroys it, damaging his car in the process.<br><br>That is literally insane.  I have never heard the like in my life.<br><br>28<br><br><br><br>Denise Hadfield<br>6 days ago<br>I think Charles lives in the same reality as Andrew.

Really who do these Royals think they are…<br><br>19<br><br><br><br>ftwi1<br>6 days ago<br>That’s why I really do think any leaders,, I mean any leaders,, has to have some form of realism in their day to day activities.

I doubt Andrew or mummy ever made a pot of tea.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>C J<br>6 days ago<br>Meghan and Harry rushed into the marriage. She grew up in a different culture socially and economically. Harry grew-up always having access to having a car gassed and ready when he wanted it, never had to make a loaf of bread for a family of 4 last a week, At least Meghan knew gas costs money, paying staff, publicist, private secuirity costs money.

These combined with the fact he was in a universe where everything revolves around him and his wish, it’s not surprising he’s ended up as he has.

I was part of the welcome party. We were told if anyone took pictures on their camera phones (which were still quite new then - this was the year before iPhones) his security team would seize and confiscate the phones. When he arrived he was brusque, rude and dismissive. He seemed annoyed to be there and couldn’t get away fast enough. He was so bad that the MD of the company had to send out an email afterwards practically apologising on his behalf.

Lok | Feb 17, 2021 | Latest News & Rumors, Movie News | 0  |     <br><br>Gremlins Appear in First Live-Action Material in 31 Years…As Mountain Dew Ad<br>This is the first live-action material that featured Gremlins in 31 years, ever since Gremlins 2: The New Batch in 1990. And as it turns out, it’s a commercial for Mountain Dew. Well, I guess there are worse things to advertise.<br><br><br>Oh, Billy, when are you ever going to learn that feeding Gremlins in general is a Bad Idea?<br>The premise of this Gremlins Mountain Dew ad is pretty simple. Little…well, big Billy Peltzer now (still played by Zach Galligan), is drinking a bottle of Mountain Dew Zero Sugar. It’s exactly what it sounds like, Mountain Dew but made with artificial sweeteners. So of course, when Gizmo begs in an adorable voice for some, Billy thinks that it wouldn’t harm anyone if he gave the little guy some. Probably thought that the zero sugar bit meant that it didn’t count as food. Well, it probably doesn’t, but he forgot what Mountain Dew contains a lot of water.<br><br>So of course, Gizmo splashes some of the Mountain Dew on himself. The little guy quickly starts popping out more gremlins from his back, all the while squeaking “Too tasty!”. Yeah, even Billy’s daughter when she walks in rolls her eyes at him. The gremlin on her shoulder even pulls a Xiao Mei and copies her for added effect. Maybe this time, Billy will learn not to feed the little guy, no matter how adorably he begs for it. Maybe.<br><br>Fullmetal Alchemist scene featuring May Chang and Xiao Mei, doing basically what the gremlin did.<br>Definitely seeing the resemblance here.<br>GREMLINS AD: VERDICT?<br>Gizmo mouthing a Mountain Dew bottle in Gremlins ad.<br>Hard to argue with cuteness.<br>All in all, I actually liked this Gremlins-themed Mountain Dew ad. You know how you sometimes get these commercials that you watch all the way through because they’re so amusing or funny? Well, I would definitely count this ad as one of them. With the humor, the ever-adorable Gizmo, and all the nods to Gremlins fans, this is definitely a very watchable ad. Indeed, I’d put it on the level of the Hotels.com ads featuring Captain Obvious, really.<br><br><br>I know, you didn’t come here just to watch another ad. But this might be worth your time.<br>And really, in the world of ads, there are worse things to advertise than sugar-free Mountain Dew. Much worse.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br>Gremlins just got its first live-action material in 31 years. Unfortunately, it’s an ad for sugar-free Mountain Dew. Fortunately, it’s actually pretty entertaining. Don’t agree? Watch the ad for yourself and decide if you think it’s worth watching.<br><br>Source: JoBlo.com<br><br>FROM THE WEBPowered by ZergNet<br><br>It's Clearly No Secret That Henry Cavill Is A Terrible Dude<br><br>Games Nintendo Needs To Bring To The Switch Immediately<br><br>Game Of Thrones Actor Arrested Over Very Disturbing Allegations<br><br>Superheroes Who Sadly Died In 2019<br><br>Movie Villains Who Are Actually Bombshells In Real Life<br><br>The Freddie Mercury Lyrics That Truly Worried Queen Members<br><br>Malia Obama's Transformation Has Been Turning Heads<br><br>The Tragedy Of Jenna Jameson Just Gets Sadder And Sadder<br>SHARE:<br><br> RATE:12345<br>PREVIOUSCould A Rian Johnson Trilogy Still Be Good For Star Wars?NEXTFuture State: Immortal Wonder Woman 2<br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br>B.K.

She sang the title song and melted my heart. Then she won the Oscar! I was beyond happy! The joy and love I felt was indescribable!<br><br>64<br>1<br><br><br><br>Jake Birchfield<br>2 years ago<br>Angela Lansbury is the definition of class and humility. I met her coming into the production of Blythe Spirit a few years ago. I give flowers for her dressing room and she couldn’t have been more grateful or appreciative. She is my ultimate fave celebrity!!<br><br>53<br>1<br><br><br><br>SXiPPY Dennison<br>2 years ago<br>This woman is a living legend and a national treasure!<br><br>212<br>2<br><br><br><br>Florence Young<br>2 years ago<br>I loved her in Murder She Wrote!  She is a beautiful, talented and versatile actress!<br><br>131<br>4<br><br><br><br>Rainey P<br>2 years ago<br>She was such a talented performer! Loved her in everything she did!<br><br>60<br><br><br><br>diane jeffries<br>2 years ago<br>I'm still watching Murder She Wrote Ms Lansbury does an excellent job portraying Jessica Fletcher & she really looked good for a woman of a particular  age<br><br>194<br>12<br><br><br><br>Erica J<br>2 years ago<br>Awwww thank you guys for doing this! I love love love this woman! “Murder She Wrote “ is my absolute favorite show of all time. I have awesome nostalgic memories of this show from when I was a kid hence the reason why I still watch it now as an adult😊<br><br>51<br>2<br><br><br>Barbie Liu<br>1 year ago<br>Love murder she wrote. A great show! Well played by Angela. Still watches when airs on tv.<br><br>29<br><br><br>Rosie Debevc<br>1 year ago<br>This lady is a living legend and definitely a national treasure.<br><br>15<br><br><br>Kathie Wade<br>1 year ago<br>I have watched and loved her in movies all my life and was thrilled to learn more about her. Thank you.<br><br>22<br>1<br><br><br>Josephine Huerta<br>7 months ago (edited)<br>Everything she touches turns to gold. There has never been such a character as the one Angela Lansbury so perfectly portrays in MSW. The show had everything; comedy, drama, suspense and of course, the “whodunnit “ factor. As for her other roles.. pure classic acting. I go out of my way to find movies and show she stars in, no matter what it is.<br><br>4<br>1<br><br><br>Dora Victorino<br>5 months ago<br>Señora Ángela la queremos muchiiiiimo, la llevamos en el corazón, y repetimos sus series como si nunca las hubiéramos visto,   muchas gracias, Dios la bendiga<br><br>1<br><br><br>Helen Diaz<br>1 year ago<br>Absolutely fascinating lady!! Never knew her background. Love her work and work ethic, she radiates kindness x<br><br>20<br><br><br>APG X<br>1 year ago<br>Angela Lansbury is a great role model. God bless her with health and happiness.<br><br>16<br><br><br>Jenean McBrearty<br>4 months ago<br>I own the entire series on DVD. My cat, Mr. Baxter, would watch it with me. When I broke my leg in 2014, my daughter took care of Mr. Baxter, and would soothe his separation anxiety by playing episodes so he could hear the theme song. It's amazing how it calmed him right down; it reminded him of me. Alas, he is gone but I and Angela keep on truckin'.<br><br>2<br><br><br>Rose Munn<br>1 year ago<br>Love her, watch her every day, such comfort and fun. Excellent production and the money spent to make every episode the best is noticeable, so many extras, special locations, and a lot of old time Actors and Actresses of days gone bye. What a great Lady, and the Queen agrees!<br><br>7<br>1<br><br><br>AM Hunter<br>1 year ago<br>She is my all time favourite, one incredibly talented woman!<br><br>6<br><br><br>Descendants Of Grayskull<br>1 year ago<br>Angela Lansbury is an icon. I love Murder She Wrote, Bedknobs and Broomsticks and her rendition of Tale as Old as Time is my all time favourite version.<br><br>5<br><br><br>Susan Kelly<br>9 months ago (edited)<br>So much warmth exudes from Angela Lansbury on screen, you can warm your hands in the glow! Watching her in a role brightens my day, and makes me feel happy! Yet she can make me cry in ' The Picture of Dorian Gray'. A wonderful person and actor.❤️❤️❤️<br><br>1<br><br><br>DAMON LEE<br>1 year ago<br>I am currently addicted to the reruns each day in the mornings I wake up early just to watch. crazy, but the show was on during my high school years and never paid attention long enough, but now it's all a nostalgia trip.<br><br>2<br><br><br>Lora Ross<br>2 years ago (edited)<br>I was lucky enough to see her in a revival of Mame on B'Way summer 1983.  (This was just before Murder She Wrote came her way. ) She was Fantastic!!!  She was in her late 50s then, but she could kick up her legs as high as younger cast member.  Tons of folks were at the stage door, so I couldn't get close enough to get an autograph, but I'll always remember seeing her.  I loved her in Death on the Nile among her many other roles.<br><br>4<br><br><br>LightOnAHill<br>1 year ago<br>She's someone I'd like to know. You can tell she's great fun and extremely classy.<br><br>9<br><br><br>se na<br>10 months ago<br>Je m'en lasserais jamais de cette belle série que j'adore et j'en raffole dommage elle passe plus a la télé .<br><br>1<br><br><br>Mário Amaral<br>9 months ago<br>Uma grande atriz cujos filmes assisti várias vezes !!<br><br>1<br><br><br>Loopymcgeee<br>2 years ago<br>I watch Murder She Wrote every night.

Pena que no encuentro alguna pagina para verla !!!!<br><br>1<br><br><br>Beautiful girl<br>2 years ago<br>I loved her in murder she wrote when I was a kid.<br><br>55<br>1<br><br><br>Kim Berman<br>7 months ago<br>They don't make 'em like Angela any more. <br>Love her, love her, love her 🥰<br><br>2<br><br><br>Linda Moore<br>1 year ago<br>Angela Lansbury is a great actress who has been underrated and denied awards. Her greatest performances Gaslight and The Manchurian Candidate where she "stole the show" from the lead actors. Today I watch Murder She Wrote reruns often at bedtime because they help me relax. Thank you Miss Lansbury for the wonderful entertainment you have provided.<br><br>1<br>1<br><br><br>Margi<br>5 months ago (edited)<br>Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones came to Australia and did the stage play of "Driving Miss Daisy" 8 or 9 years ago.  Magical to watch both of them perform on the stage.<br><br><br><br>Lyn Michael<br>4 months ago<br>I have watched her for a long time. Watched all of Murder She Wrote, it’s really a great show. Her movies are great too. Really wish I could have met her, after watching her so much I felt like I knew her, sorta.<br><br><br><br>Linda Morales<br>1 year ago<br>She is incredible.  I have always loved her in her movies.  No matter what script she would get, she stood out with her acting.  She is a legend.  God bless her.<br><br>1<br>1<br><br><br>Maria Bowen<br>1 year ago<br>I love her wardrobe on Murder She Wrote...

I saw her in Sweeny Todd but really loved her in Murder She Wrote.  God Bless her and keep her safe!<br><br>2<br><br><br>Mary Nace<br>8 months ago<br>She is one of a kind and inapiratuon  to all of us thank you for sharing  your life and talents 😀❣<br><br>1<br><br><br>Chirelle.

NATO is not sending an army, but NATO is fighting Russia with Ukrainian lives. If history is any guide, this war will go on for a long time. When a superpower invades and another superpower sends arms to the invaded country, the war goes on and on. The US invaded Vietnam and the Soviets supplied arms to Viet Cong. Similarly, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and US supplied missiles to Afghans. Both wars caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions displaced. This is a slow and ugly process. US and NATO's stated goal is "to weaken Russia" (Loyd Austin) instead of defending Ukraine, it is indeed a proxy war. Defending Ukraine is not the same thing as "to weaken Russia" a stated goal of the US and NATO.

Preppers have been doing this for years. They use the knowledge available to them to ensure that they can survive any contingency. Those that don't think about survival are doomed to die. Those that do think and talk about it, would be ready. <br><br>Admittedly, anyone who has not studied this subject before may find that it's too late to do much right now. It's not just about having the right equipment, but obtaining the skills needed to survive and then locating yourself somewhere that is unlikely to be affected by the results of the exchange. Follow the Boy Scouts motto - 'Be Prepared'.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Cletus Jones<br>2 weeks ago<br> @WOT Arty Noobs  I think the key to surviving nuclear war is being in a place where the bombs aren’t likely to fall. However a full on nuclear exchange would altar the climate so drastically I don’t think surviving would be very pleasant.<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>Gx19 Films<br>2 weeks ago<br>Discuss it anyway<br><br><br><br><br>The General - World of Tanks Replays<br>2 weeks ago<br> @Cletus Jones  Correct.<br><br><br><br><br>The General - World of Tanks Replays<br>2 weeks ago<br> @SCPython  There is a subtle difference between Vietnam/Afghanistan and the Ukraine conflict. In both Vietnam and Afghanistan, the other side tolerated the arms supplied by the other without making nuclear threats. There were some who advocated bombing Haiphong harbor to sink Soviet supply vessels, but it was not carried out as it was too provocative. Similarly, the Soviets did not attack Pakistan for allowing the Mujaheddin receiving missiles from the Americans. <br><br>Russia did make it a Red Line event if NATO flew Polish MiG-29 into Ukraine airspace to supply the Ukrainian Air Force. Which is why despite the offers, this has not taken place. You are correct in that NATO is intending to 'bleed' Russia until they get tired and unable to continue. NATO intends to make Putin realize that the only way to avoid his forces being wiped out altogether is to withdraw them and declare that he has done all he needed to do - a Pyrrhic victory at best. If he refuses to withdraw, then his forces will do it for him when they are unable to continue and either surrender or mutiny.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>Sam Young<br>2 weeks ago<br> @mnm mnm  someone sounds like they’re in denial<br><br><br><br><br>REVO 13<br>2 weeks ago<br>See Jason Robards in “The Day After”<br><br><br><br><br>quartermaster1976<br>2 weeks ago<br>It almost happened by mistake several times we almost blew each other up several times<br><br><br><br><br>George Einstein<br>2 weeks ago<br>Requirem for the American  Dream by Norm Chomsky  on Utube is a must for a very good understanding.<br><br><br><br><br>George Einstein<br>2 weeks ago<br> @Lone Ranger 22  Ukraine won't tolerate being the next Hong Kong.<br><br>1<br><br><br><br>E Ekiane<br>2 weeks ago<br>😂😂😂 I thought I was the only 1.<br><br><br><br><br>E Ekiane<br>2 weeks ago<br> @Cletus Jones  we could put pressure on our politicians to stop arming Ukraine and find a peaceful solution.<br><br><br><br><br>colin powis<br>2 weeks ago<br>We lived under a cloud of nuclear war for so long that we became smug in our conceit that it could never happen , UNTIL IT DOES<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Frieda Conradie<br>2 weeks ago (edited)<br> @scotty3861  no it  will not happen it's not in bible prophecy!!!<br><br><br><br><br>The No Such Thing Podcast<br>11 days ago<br>Tell me about it.

Whether Russia deems this to be necessary depends entirely on Russia's threat perception, not yours, which is entirely irrelevant.

Nuclear war is no joke.<br><br>13<br>2<br><br><br>Geoffrey Reeks<br>1 day ago<br>Considering that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for a promise from the UK and from the USA to defend Ukraine from attack, it is disgusting beyond belief that the UK and the USA would say "We will not defend Ukraine". That brings immeasurable dishonor upon the UK and upon the USA. I (as an Australian) am reminded of Britain promising to defend Australia before World War II and then abandoning us when war came. Our response of the time was to develop chemical weapons in Homebush Bay, (Sydney) (the subsoil of which is still contaminated) and to develop biological weapons in the basement of the Wagga Wagga hospital. Similarly, small nations will now commence building biological, chemical and nuclear weapons for their own defense. Indonesia has announced that it will use its five nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons. Japan, has been building the precursors for their nuclear weapons and for their delivery systems for many years. It is now likely that Japan will make the final step and become a nuclear power. The damage from this UK and USA dishonor will last for a century. It will be the century of shame for the UK and for the USA. Millions of people will die needlessly as a result. Australian has invested more than 100 years in fighting with the UK and with the USA. If the UK and the USA will not honor a commitment in which Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons then Australia cannot rely upon the UK or upon the USA to help us. Any words that the UK or the USA might say in response are meaningless. The UK and the USA were honor bound to send troops to help Ukraine retrieve the Crimean Peninsula and other areas of Ukraine taken by Russia. The UK and the USA are too afraid that helping Ukraine as they promised would cause World War III. Yet, they made that promise to Ukraine in order to remove nuclear weapons from Ukraine and so reduce the risk of nuclear war.  Small nations, (such as Australia), cannot now rely upon the UK or upon the USA. There is also the looting of the Ukrainian treasury by corrupt Russian sympathetic politicians and Russian Plutarchs. Also there is the accusation that while President Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, he engaged in corrupt activities relating to the employment of his son Hunter Biden by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Of course, I do not know the truth of these reportedly corrupt activities. Though, they deserve to be investigated in the light of current events. Regards, Geoff.

So Mr Helfand call for abolishing nuclear weapons' world wide , without actually even mention the reason those exist and are still developing in first place. As a scientist I would like to point attention to the reason for those weapon to exist. In my opinion that is wide spread tolerance for military aggression , on the highest level possible. No country in the world could feel safe unless posses one of those nuclear weapons. So Mr Helfand, instead of just calling for ban of nuclear weapons  at United Nation level, we all need to call for ban on millenary aggression ! Yes ! Not just Russia military's aggression recently but all military intervention in the recent history beginning from WWII. Military aggression that is almost inbuild into superpowers program. If I wishes to be satirical in such tragic topic I would say New Amendment  written into constitution that given superpower must be engaged now in one or two military's conflicts constantly since WWII !!!. There is not a single condemnation in the speech above about conventionally conducted conflicts, intervention or war. Absolute tolerance on every level of UN , with UN nation even itself engaging in such activity < under very suspicious pretenses most of the time. This remark is not intended as a critique of those countries but as argument that lead us to main thesis here: WE NEED TO DECLEARE BAN ON MILITARY AGRESSION IN GENERAL. As consequences UN should then promote strict control of military budget as % of GDP of each country., Than APPLY SANCTION to those that do not obey, Then request program to steady decrease those expenses from commonly accepted 2% to 0.2% at the best or even less in the future. Countries should be advised to decrease their military might, but under some protection under UN promise instead. To illustrate even country in middle of Africa, hot spot  could minimize their army if all neighbors will be forced to do the same. Those that disobey UN will face strongest sanctions possible.  <br>Funds saved on military's expenses ( and those saved on damage inflicted by conflicts) could be then targeted to the subjects that really need humanity attention : climate, ecology degradation etc<br>Another serious mistake in the discussion above is assumption the main danger lay in nuclear weapons ( because they do extinguish whole humanity at once) . Misconception. For every human being there is only one life, one chance to live. Whey you die, The whole world die with you, for you. To see this level you need to rich a bit higher perspective of ant colony, humanity. When individual needs to scarify for the good of the rest. Not true at all. I can prove so but I doubt many could understand the logic. <br>But consequences are prefund. For example in this Ukrainian conflict the largest country on Earth could be grinded to powder using traditional, conventional weapons beside nuke at all . Then this fact do not rich our presenters at all . How the biggest country in the world could be now legally grinded for very suspicious pretense ( I am not taking sides in this or any other conflict!! I am against all conflicts and use of force !) The next is the most populous country on Earth that can be grinded also using traditional weapons . which will be totally legal under existing law and UN watch. How it is fair? That only illustrate that the smaller countries and nations have absolutely nothing to say in existing world if somebody for self interest decide to harm them or wipe of the map,.<br>At the end I would like to congratulate Dr. Michael Klare on common sense presented ability and I agree with him in most cases.<br><br>2<br><br><br>O Dem<br>13 days ago<br>Thanks for a great presentation, just one question, has any research been done on reversing a nuclear reaction so that a nuclear explosion is reversed or disabled in some way?<br><br>2<br>5<br><br><br>Cr Hu<br>2 weeks ago<br>1:15:10 the risk is higher because Russia has lost its strategic position since loss of Baltics Moldova and Ukraine, even assuming Belarus remains loyal.

Perhaps one day, in a new world with a new political reality, perhaps a post-nuclear world should we ever get there, but in the current climate and with current levels of human consciousness, it would be unlikely. Why is it then the case that so many western experts expect Russia to do this in respect of Ukraine and other former Soviet Republics, while the USA and its allies go around the world shooting up any country they please in their self defined role as global policeman? I welcome initiatives and attempts to ban and remove all nuclear weapons from all states, every sane person may hold this position. The deterrent policy of MAD makes use of nuclear weapons futile for humankind as a whole, not to mention all the other life forms on our shared planet. The problem here is that even such serious discussions as these are undermined by the participants maintaining a selective view of the current conflict in Ukraine where the Russians have a far more justifiable case for intervention than did the USA and its allies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and many other countries where they intervened. The lack of objectivity in this regard mitigates against the possibility of such people being capable of negotiating a nuclear free world treaty, because any agreement they would seek would only be acceptable to them where it allows for continued USA Hegemony.<br><br>7<br>5<br><br><br>Telum Atramenti<br>2 weeks ago<br>"Eliminating nuclear weapons" is certainly not a good long-term solution, because it will inevitably lead to prolonged, bloody conflicts with the use of the old trench warfare. Invading a country like Russia is a far worse nightmare than invading a country like the Afghanistan. Russian military doctrine is geared not towards establishing air superiority but rather denying air superiority to its opponents, with all types of surface to air, sea to air, handheld "Igla" type anti aircraft weapons, highly mobile and easily concealable through the "maskirovka" tactics Panzir SMs, "Shilkas", with a large number of inflatable decoys and "sleeper" snare radars. Given abundance of forested areas, limitation of maximum range for sea-based and EU landstrip based fighter jets and bombers, as well as Russia's ability to launch hypersonic and aeroballistic  missiles from deep within its own territory, severely stressing the already thin anti-missile defence installations. And we're not talking just one conflict, knowing our history as species we will slaughter each other in millions even billions unless and until there is a notion of some type of Mutually Assured Destruction.

The only solution to the threat of nuclear war that I see is law and order on a global basis. We need to have laws that regulate the behavior between countries. We need also a military force that is able to enforce these laws on the global basis. The current international system cannot deliver on that regard. Therefore we seem to need a global government that controls all the nuclear weapons and has a monopoly on violence.<br><br>3<br><br><br>mcmxli1941<br>2 weeks ago<br>Yes, Hungary was encouraged to revolt in 1956, and NATO did not intervene.

Your job is to make the other poor bastard die for his country”<br><br>1.9K<br>60<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>Well one of his first in Italy included also something like don´t take prisoners which acutely caused some war crimes and you would hang our officers which gave such orders. What´s then extra bad is how just the lower ranks which acted on the speech got punished and he is still a war hero.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  how much research have you actually done on this subject? Sounds like you just watched a video and went with it<br><br>13<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  Comes from a actual historian, here are a lot on Youtube. "General George S. Patton, The Biscari Massacre and The Slapping Incidents" <br><br>Kinda almost a funny story how he rather got in trouble later for slapping someone and not just making a speech where he calls for no prisoners and then later wants to cover it up when unarmed prisoner get shoot. <br><br>Like allied war crimes are not really something so rare, my village is even famous for being completely burned down by Canadians as retaliation for a SS crime. Not really something common like on both east fronts where they happen probably each day dozen of times but still there where also some in the west. <br><br>While basically all sides terror bombed civilians to break there moral and well this even seemed to backfire and strengthen moral until the US started to drop nukes. To be fair they also bombed the Chinese whit the pest and probably would have caused such a blood bath if invaded this was probably the way to get the least amount of people killed but i am pretty sure nuking civilians is not legal by international law as well as to fire bomb them to death in the 100.´s of thousands. <br><br>I mean are you Americans kinda unaware you also did commit some war crimes? For example what you called moral bombing is basically the same as our idea to terror bomb civilians which is just by any definition a war crime. Also just because the other side starts ignoring international law mean not your also free to ignore it, the Soviet Union had just left all international agreements but that makes the dozens of millions dead POW´s and civilians not better. <br><br>When you really look into this there seems to be quite a doable standard where US war crimes are somewhere between ignored and justified.<br><br>4<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  George Patton said “dont take prisoners” her didnt say “shoot prisoners”. Their is a difference and that is why Patton didn’t get into trouble for the massacre.<br><br>16<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  Kinda makes it not much better when he told his soldiers to shoot people which lay down there arms which no prisoners means. So they basically got in trouble for doing it not soon enough and accepting surrender. <br><br>While he still tried to cover it up and someone else pushed for an investigation, a German would been executed by the allies for this for sure. <br><br>Also just one of the two guy´s killing prisoners got even convicted, not quite sure what this legal principle is exactly  you call Respondeat superior but sounds kinda like for your soldiers they got to make the defense of just following orders when they did not commit any war crimes on there own but where ordered. Which was just not done for Germans where they are responsible for any criminal act if ordered or not.<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  It war and people die in war. You want to argue semantics then ok. A prisoner is defined as “a person captured and kept in by an enemy, opponent or criminal.” Therefore, if they shot the Germans without capturing them, they don’t fit the legal definition if “prisoner”. Therefore General Patton wasn’t ordering his men to commit war crimes because it wouldn’t have been a war crime.<br><br>11<br><br><br><br>king oli<br>8 months ago<br>​ @Red_Dawn1984  No that´s really not semantics oi argue about, more legal and moral responsibility, you are making it about this. It´s really not a huge difference what he ordered was to not take anybody prisoner which still keep fighting when they got at 200 yards which sounds like the idea was to demoralize the enemy. Meaning when they lay down there arms to late his soldiers where suppose to make an example out of them, pretty clear what he was doing there and i bet you Germans giving similar orders would be charged and pretty likely be justified executed. That´s just an clear war crime, look at this, it´s even worse then i had remembered it. 100% any German you captured and you know about giving such orders would be killed for it. <br><br>"When we land against the enemy, don’t forget to hit him and hit him hard. We will bring the fight home to him. We will show him no mercy. He has killed thousands of your comrades, and he must die. If you company officers in leading your men against the enemy find him shooting at you and, when you get within two hundred yards of him and he wishes to surrender, oh no! That bastard will die! You will kill him. Stick him between the third and fourth ribs. You will tell your men that. They must have the killer instinct. Tell them to stick him. He can do no good then. Stick them in the liver. We will get the name of killers and killers are immortal. When word reaches him that he is being faced by a killer battalion, a killer outfit, he will fight less. Particularly, we must build up that name as killers and you will get that down to your troops in time for the invasion"<br><br>5<br><br><br><br>Red_Dawn1984<br>8 months ago<br> @king oli  you are claiming that he told his troops to commit a war crime. You made it about legality, I’m arguing that what he ordered his men to do wasn’t illegal and therefore not a war crime. Now what his men did do was a war crime because they accepted the enemy surrender and killed them afterwards when they were actually prisoners. You can surrender all day long but you aren’t legally a prisoner until you are captured. You aren’t considered captured until the enemy accepts your surrender.<br><br>10<br><br><br><br>Missy Victoria<br>8 months ago<br>I like when Gen Geo S Patton said "we have beaten the wrong enemy".. referring to Hitler. Patton was going to come out with the truth about Allies and Communist collaboration to beat Hitler... and he was in a seriously life-threatening automobile "accident." 12 days into his recovery while in the hospital... he was poisoned to death. No doubt, by his own country. "Merica!<br><br>3<br><br><br><br>Kyle Rittenhouse's AR-15<br>7 months ago<br> @king oli  <br><br>That's not what happened. Patton ordered that any enemy units that hadn't surrendered by the time American forces got within 200 yards, then any attempted surrender should not be accepted. In those massacres however, the surrender had been accepted and then the prisoners were summarily executed.<br><br>So no, they weren't following Patton's orders. Which is exactly why he was not implicated in those proceedings.

At the time, he was only 11 years old. Throughout the years of Japan’s occupation of Malaya, my grandpa had shared stories of their cruelty, he and my great grandmother had been beaten ruthlessly by Japanese troops for reasons such as not bowing to an officer or sometimes seemingly for no reason at all. Fearing that my great grandmother would’ve been raped eventually, this had led to him urging my great grandmother into running away and hiding in the jungles. From what he told me, they essentially lived through hell. For 4 years, they were starving and were in constant fear of the Japanese patrols finding them. My great grandmother fell ill from diseases caused by mosquitoes and without medical supplies, she passed away. With her gone, my grandfather was on his own  for another year until news broke out that the Japanese had surrendered due to the atom bombings. It was one of the happiest moments of his life. Furthermore, with years of jungle experience, my grandfather grew up to be a police captain fighting against the communist forces in the jungle during what is now known as the Malayan Communist Insurgency.<br><br>659<br>41<br><br><br><br>Cipher Code<br>7 months ago<br>fishing.
