After a tree falls on the house, the four children are sent to Smuggler's Top, the home of Mr Lenoir, a fellow-scientist of George's father, Uncle Quentin. Smuggler's Top is a queer house at the summit of an old hilltop coastal town, partly surrounded by dangerous marsh. The children are welcomed by Pierre "Sooty" Lenoir (Julian's and Dick's schoolmate and Mr Lenoir's stepson) and his half-sister Marybelle. Mr Lenoir hates dogs, so George's dog Timmy is hidden in a secret passage. One night, the boys spot a light flashing in the house's tower. They suspect the signaller may be Block, the house's sinister, apparently deaf manservant, but he appears to be sleeping in his bedroom at the time. Uncle Quentin comes to stay with them and intends to sell Mr Lenoir a plan for draining the marsh. More excitement follows. <BR> <BR> —Wikipedia. [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

Julian's parents assent and hire two caravans for the children. They travel to Merran Lake, where they are reacquainted with Nobby and meet various animals. The Five camp on a hillside, much to the annoyance of Nobby's guardian, Tiger Dan, and an acrobat named Lou, who want them to leave. One of the caravans of the children is directly above the entrance to a network of caves, where Tiger Dan and Lou have hidden stolen valuables. Assisted by Nobby, Timmy and a chimpanzee named Pongo, the four children manage to outwit the crooks. After the criminals are arrested, Nobby leaves the circus to live with a local farming couple and look after their horses. >>> —Wikipedia. [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>
