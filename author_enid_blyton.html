Enid Blyton seized on this and used it for material in many of her stories and this entire book deals with a family who shared their love with a variety of animals and birds that were fortunate enough to be placed in a home called Green Meadows. The given title doesn't reveal much and one might consider the novel in the same light as perhaps The Happy House Children or others of the Enid Blyton family-life collection but when the fifth or so chapter is reached there's a feeling that there's a retinue of pets in store. Naturally, the thrill of preparing an environment for them can be re-experienced as we remember our own efforts to construct a cage for a budgie, a kennel for a dog or even a vivarium for a newt.

The bombing by the Third Reich devastated key areas of the country amongst which included Birmingham, Coventry, Plymouth, Manchester and especially London. It was common sense to evacuate the young people away from the action instead of having to make up beds on the platforms and the escalators of the underground railways. Two such evacuees were Tom and Sheila who were sent from London to live in the quieter surroundings of a village in Scotland. They found remoteness with a capital "R" because they ended up in Kidillin which could bring to mind a cosy little Scottish comunity. There are just three shops in Kidillin but plenty of hills and streams and heather and animals and the sea is only a few miles away where gulls can be seen rising high over the cliffs in the distance. Tom and Sheila arrive to be greeted by their cousins and hosts — Sandy and Jeanie MacLaren. [Suggest a different description.]</td></tr>

So says Enid Blyton on the flap and I can only agree with her. I read this book as a youngster and was completely taken into the spirit of the season with the children — Benny, Susan, Ann and Peter. It is an account of one family's Christmas experience right from when the older children arrive home for the school holidays and it is told as a story which ends on the Big Day itself. An associate of Enid Blyton — L. Brimble, helped with information as to origins and meanings of the various Christmas rituals and jolly interesting they are. Did you know — according to the book, Charles II liked loin of beef so much that he knighted it and it is now Sir Loin and if you don't believe me there's a picture of Charlie performing the ritual! >>> In a way, the book deals with a perfect Christmas because everything is there.

Then, just when everything seems to have smoothed over again, Jimmy's beloved dog Lucky suddenly goes missing. Lotta sets out alone on a daring mission to find and rescue Lucky—but will she succeed?

Peter inadvertently asks to go to the land of "Goodness-Knows-Where", but in the process of going there the Wishing-Chair is stolen. They eventually get it back and a few days later, the Wishing-Chair only grows three wings. They end up in the Land of Slipperies and when Peter offends one of them, they retaliate by chopping all the chair's wings off, so they get some ointment which grows the wings back. On the next rainy day, they inadvertently grow wings on their toys and the toys end up at Mr Grim's school where mischievous brownies are sent. They befriend a brownie called Winks and successfully get Mr Grim to relinquish the toys. Winks takes up residence in Peter and Mollie's house and they take him on adventures, but on the last day of the holidays, he is sent back to Mr Grim's school for being too naughty.—Wikipedia.

Absolutely astounding how times have changed, totally casual attitude to zoo animals dying during capture and transport. You can feed the animals. Good photos.
